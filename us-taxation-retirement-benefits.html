    <h1>Social security and medicare taxes</h1>
    <p>
      The Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) imposes two taxes on employers, employees, and self-employed workers:
      <ul>
        <li>one for Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance (OASDI; commonly known as the Social Security tax)</li>
        <li>the other for Hospital Insurance (HI; commonly known as the Medicare tax)</li>        
      </ul>
      There is a maximum amount of compensation subject to the OASDI tax, but no maximum for HI.
      For 2018, an employee will pay:
      <ol type='a'>
        <li>6.2% Social Security tax on the first $128,700 of wages, plus</li>
        <li>1.45% Medicare tax on the first $200,000 of wages, plus</li>
        <li>2.35% Medicare tax (regular 1.45% Medicare tax + 0.9% additional Medicare tax) on all wages in excess of $200,000</li>
      </ol>
      <br/>
      Sadly it doth appears that H1B visas are not exempt from the social security tax.
