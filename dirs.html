<dt><b>/etc/rc.local</b></dt><dd>This is a file; not a directory - ideal place to easily add services
to start at startup - it's guaranteed to run after all /etc.rc.<i>n</i> levels.<p>
Important: (a) call any service scripts in the background
(b) there is no need to worry about nohup. For completeness, here's the /etc/rc.local script I 've been using in COAST:
<p>
[/etc/rc.local script starts on the next line:]<p>
<pre>
#!/bin/sh -e
#
# rc.local
#
# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.
# Make sure that the script will "exit 0" on success or any other
# value on error.
#
# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution
# bits.
#
# By default this script does nothing.
cd /home/mperdikeas/coast-dpi-ws/dpi-populator ; ./start_dpi_populator_infloop >> out.log &
cd /home/mperdikeas/coast-dpi-ws/dpi-web-service ; ./start_dpi_web_service >> out.log &
exit 0

[/etc/rc.local script ended on the previous line]
