        The user that is running the docker commands (if he is a non-root user) must be added in the <ti>docker</ti> group.
        This is done with the following incantation:
        <pre>sudo usermode -aG docker $USER</pre>
        &hellip; but only takes effect after a system reboot.
        In the meantime you can use <tt>newgrp docker</tt> in the shell you're working (this will result in a new shell with the
        current user being part of the <tt>docker</tt> group).

        In November 2024 when going through <a href='https://docker-curriculum.com/#docker-run'>this docker beginners tutorial</a>
        (also saved <a href='docker.html.files/a-docker-tutorial-for-beginners.pdf'>here</a>)
        I encountered <a href='docker.html.files/a-docker-tutorial-for-beginners.problem.png'>this trace</a>:
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end I had to change the <tt>docker build</tt> invocation from:
        <pre>docker build . -t mperdikeas/catnip</pre>
        to:
        <pre>docker build . --network host -t mperdikeas/catnip</pre>
      </p>

        In initially commented on an already existing bug report
        and then reported my solution <a href='https://github.com/prakhar1989/docker-curriculum/issues/373'>here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The solution was found in
        <a href='https://github.com/StefanScherer/dockerfiles-windows/issues/270'>this thread</a>
        which also reports at least one additional approach.
