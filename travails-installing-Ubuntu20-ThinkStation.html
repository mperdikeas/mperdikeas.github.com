      I lost a huge amount of time trying to enter BIOS / UEFI from the thrice-accursed accursed windows pseudo-operating system.
      In the end I discovered I had to disable the <i>Windows 10 Fast Startup</i> (as explained
      <a href='https://www.windowscentral.com/how-disable-windows-10-fast-startup'>here</a>).
      In my case it was further complicated as my BIOS didn't support UEFI (the machine has 'Legacy' BIOS).
    </p>
    <p>
      Subsequently, I lost some time trying to discover which are the keys to enter BIOS on a ThinkStation
      machine and when to press them. I discovered it is <b>F1</b> and that, crucially,
      you need to press them <b>immediately</b> after the start of a power cycle.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then managed to enter BIOS and after changing the boot order, I successfully booted from a USB flash
      drive I had created using <i>USB Creator</i> as advised <a href='http://mperdikeas.github.io/travails-setting-up-T510.html#create-bootable-usb-flash-drives'>here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then installed emacs and modified the <tt>GRUB</tt> settings as shown <a href='https://askubuntu.com/a/754875'>here</a>
      and then entered CRUB by pressing <tt>ESC</tt> (or <tt>SHIFT</tt>) while rebooting and started a memory test. However, the test hung up on me and I was unable to enter the CRUB menu again.
