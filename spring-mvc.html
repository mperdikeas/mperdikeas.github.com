      <p>
        <a id='how-to-upload-files-with-spring-source' href='https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.3.5.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html#mvc-multipart'>source</a>
      </p>
      <p>I had a form working in the Spring MVC way (Models, Validators and all) and was asked to add
        a file upload field. I.e. an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element with <code>type='file'</code></p>
      <p>For that it was necessary to change the form from the following:
        <br/><br/>
        <code>&lt;form:form id='the-form' modelAttribute="newAccountView" action="submit.do" method="POST"&gt;</code>
        &hellip; to the following:
        <br/><br/>
        <code>&lt;form:form id='the-form' modelAttribute="newAccountView" action="submit.do" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data"&gt;</code>
        <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is very clearly stated in a number of guides.
      </p>
      <p>However, this alone does not work as I was met by a number of weird NPE exceptions (on the validators of that model).
        This was due to the fact that Spring was unable to retrieve any of the parameters present in the form due to the
        change of the form encoding (from the default <i>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</i> to <i>multipart/form-data</i>)
      </p>
      <p>To fix that I had to setup a <b>multi-part resolver</b> with my Spring application.
        So I added the following to my <code>mvc-dispatcher-servlet.xml</code>:
        <pre>
 &lt;bean id="multipartResolver"
      class="org.springframework.web.multipart.commons.CommonsMultipartResolver"&gt;
      &lt;!-- one of the properties available; the maximum file size in bytes --&gt;
      &lt;property name="maxUploadSize" value="30000000"/&gt;
 &lt;/bean&gt;</pre>
      </p>
      <p>I also had to add the following dependency to my Ivy:
        <pre>
&ltdependency org="commons-fileupload" name="commons-fileupload" rev="1.3.3" conf="run-time->default"/&gt;</pre>
      </p>
      <p>After doing the above, I added a <code>org.springframework.web.multipart.MultipartFile</code> field in my Spring MVC
        model class for that view</p>
      <p>Inside, the controller it wasn't necessary to change the signature of the method at all. I was simply able to access
        the blob doing a:
        <pre>myViewModel.getCv().getSize()</pre>
        (where <code>cv</code> was the field I added to my view model)
      </p>
      <p>For completeness purposes, here's a simplified view of my method inside the controller:
        <pre>
    @RequestMapping(path="/submit", method=RequestMethod.POST)
    public String submit(HttpServletRequest request
                               , @ModelAttribute("myModel") @Valid MyViewModel myViewModel
                               , BindingResult result
                               , Model model) {
        ...
        System.out.printf("%d bytes retrieved.\n", myViewModel.getCv().getSize());
        ...
    }
        </pre>
      </p>
      <p><b>NB:</b> At the time of this writing I have not yet experimented using the alternative multi-part resolver
provided by Spring: the <code>StandardServletMultipartResolver</code> one for Servlet 3.0 &mdash; see the <a href='#how-to-upload-files-with-spring-source'>source</a>.
