How to fetch and run the latest version of the code generator

$ wget http://172.31.128.119/NeuroCode/NeuroCode.tar.gz
$ tar xvfz [.. etc]
$ cd 'where the xml file is located'
$ mono ~/neurocode-deployed/NeuroCode/bin/NeuroCode.exe project.xml 
Missing method .ctor in assembly /usr/lib/mono/gac/System/4.0.0.0__b77a5c561934e089/System.dll, type Mono.Security.Protocol.Tls.CertificateValidationCallback2
Missing method .ctor in assembly /usr/lib/mono/gac/System/4.0.0.0__b77a5c561934e089/System.dll, type Mono.Security.Protocol.Tls.CertificateValidationCallback2

oops we forgot to remove Mono.Security.dll (see note [1] at the end of this
article)

$ find . -iname Mono.Security.dll
./bin/Mono.Security.dll
mperdikeas@mperdikeas:~/neurocode-deployed/NeuroCode#
$ rm $(find . -iname Mono.Security.dll)
mperdikeas@mperdikeas:~/neurocode-deployed/NeuroCode#


and now:
mperdikeas@mperdikeas:~/neuro-jsf-pilot-svn-stable/trunk/apps/VatRefund#
$ mono ~/neurocode-deployed/NeuroCode/bin/NeuroCode.exe project.xml 

... and everything's dandy.

Yes - you need to remove the Mono.Security.dll from the folder. It is packaged for Windows users (one of the libraries George uses depends on it) but on our machines we have much later versions of this .dll.

Patterns for sane handling of Entity-Managers, JPA
in the web tier.

[a] Always use one (1) Entity Manager only. You shouldn't
have different parts of a form access different Entity
Managers cause if that happens you may fetch an entity
in one EM that's not visible to another.

[b] Either rely on Entity Managers with extended stateful
context and don't maintain web-tier caches or have everthing
to be detached and maintain web-tier caches.

[c] A nice pattern for master-detail views is to not hang
the details from the collection of the parent entity but
rather to issue an independent JPQL query to the database
based on the parent entity selected. This allows us to 
have fine-grained logic in the detail query (e.g. an
application may only wish, for business reasons, to
display the first ten children or you can have some
ordering business requirement). Both master and detail
views should be JPA-lazy of course. This patterns
effectively means that we don't need any 1-to-many
relationships in the JPA object model as we won't be
using the collections at all.
================
PrimeFaces filtering: it is better to rely on 
JPQL to directly filter the rows in the query
sent to the database.
================
CASCADE ALL and CASCADE REMOVE. It seems that 
CASCADE ALL is not an annotation that can always, safely,
be handled at the entity model level. It may make more
sense to configure it at the application level, wherein the
same entity may be configured to be CASCADE REMOVE in one
form and not in another. I.e. use some kind of application-level
CASCADE REMOVE.
================
Difference between CASCADE and ORPHAN-REMOVAL in JPA.
Actually the two have nothing to do with one another.
"Cascade OP" has the following semantics: if operation "OP"
is invoked on a parent entity, then invoke the same operation 
on children entities. Orphan-removal has the following semantics:
When a child is removed from a collection of the parent, it is
then considered an 'orphan' and will be removed from the database
without requiring an explicit JPA removal operation.
================
It is recommended that orphan-removal be used only in
composition relationships. A composition relationship
is one in which the existence of the child entity has no 
meaning independent of its parent (typical example: invoice
and invoice lines). The danger when using orphan-removal
in a parent-child relationship that doesn't have composition
semantics is exemplified in the following scenario: Consider
the relationship municipality-citizen (clearly not one with
composition semantics). Now consider that we are trying
to move a citizen C from municipality A to municipality B
and we are doing this by removing C from A's collection
before adding him to the collection of B. In such a scenario
we may risk deleting the citizen. A more subtle and horrific
bug that can appear is the following: Consider the case
where orphan-removal is configured in the JPA entity model
and for some reason in the web layer the parent entity becomes
detached and the child records are lost (maybe if it's a lazy
collection). Then when the JPA Entity Manager fetches
the parent collection from the database and notices the missing
children in the local collection, it will remove the entities
in the database! CONCLUSION: orphan removal is considered 
harmfull.
================
When running the code generator under Mono, it is sometimes
necessary to remove file: Mono.Security.dll
from under the 'bin/' directory (in where the CodeGenerator resides).
Otherwise one receives warnings about a missing 'ctor' method
and something about security mono

* on the 1st tempo, only the .nrw file is needed.
* on the 2nd tempo, we need to modify and work on the project.xml, environment.xml and *.nrl files


================
On ttsiodras' python utility to find coordinates and produce Jasper report:
The python utility relies on C++ code (all the source - *.cc files - are included in the repo) for the image processing. The C++ code compiled and bulit normally on my Ubuntu machine requiring no external C++ libraries except the lib-SDL one which I installed with:
sudo apt-get install libsdl-image1.2          and
sudo apt-get install libsdl-image1.2-dev
The C++ code proceeds horizontally and vertically from the point clicked to find the region (so long as the colour is 10% off at most). The horizontal search has a front width of 3 pixels, the vertial of only 1 pixel.
The main file to use is gui.py which then spawns boxie.exe. Boxie writes its output in the form of "*.data" files. Dialog.py is not a self-contained python executable - it was only implemented as such to allow the program to provide a dialog without having to do it in SDL. The setupGui.py and other setup* python files are for natively compiling the python code to windows (they are invoked using Makefile.python).
