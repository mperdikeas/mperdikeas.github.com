      <h1>How to convert Audible aax files to mp3 in Linux &mdash; update April 2024</h1>
      <hr>
    </header>
    <article>
      <h2>PREAMBLE</h2>
      <p>
        The previous instructions given <a href='convert-audible-aax-files-to-mp3-linux.html'>here</a> no longer
        work as regards the script [audible-activator.py]. In particular it appears that this script (which uses Selenium)
        to navigate to one of the main Amazon/Audible sites (configurable as a command line option whether it be US, UK etc)
        is now broken, due to what has been in all likelihood a change (after so many years) in the Amazon web sites (whether intentional as a
        counter-measure to that script or not cannot be said). At any rate said script was only used to extract the activation
        bytes which are then (manually) given as command line arguments when one invokes the [AAXtoMP3] executable.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a reminder, the previous steps were:
        <ol>
          <li>download the Audiobook you have bought. There's an option for that in the Audible site (I couldn't find
            one in the Amazon site itself). See <a href='convert-audible-aax-files-to-mp3-linux.update-2024-04.html.audible-screenshot-2024-04-12.png'>this screenshot</a></li>
          <li>use the script <tt>audible-activator.py</tt> to extract an activation code from the Audible web site</li>
          <li>use the <tt>AAXtoMP3</tt> program, passing it the activation code obtained in the previous step, as a command line
          parameter, in order to convert the proprietary <tt>*.aax</tt> format into the open <tt>*.mp3</tt> format</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <h2>Current process</h2>
      <p>
        Now, therefore of the three-step process identified above, only the second (#2) step changes as the
        <tt>audible-activator.py</tt> script no longer works. Instead, I used the <i>audible tools</i> web site
        as shown in the below image:
        <a href='convert-audible-aax-files-to-mp3-linux.update-2024-04.html.audible-tools-screenshot.png'><img src='convert-audible-aax-files-to-mp3-linux.update-2024-04.html.audible-tools-screenshot.png' height='300'/></a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The website is apparently able to extract the activation bytes if you upload the <tt>*.aax</tt> file
        or even (remarkably) just it's checksum (?).
      </p>
      <p>
        I found this website in <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/audible/comments/i4o06j/new_website_where_you_can_get_your_activation/'>this Reddit discussion</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class='nb'>UPDATE 2025-01-28</span> I asked DeepSeek and I am now able to extract the
        proprietary Amazon Audible checksum using the <tt>*.aax</tt> file using the below incantation:
        <pre>ffprobe -i filename.aax -show_format 2>&1  | grep checksum</pre>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class='nb'>UPDATE 2025-03-26</span> The above page has now been redesigned; in order to use the
        site at <a href='https://audible-tools.kamsker.at/'>https://audible-tools.kamsker.at/</a> to
        obtain the activation bytes you have to click on the button that reads <i>"Expert mode"</i> &mdash; this allows you to just enter the checksum instead
        of uploading the entire file. Also, I found out (perhaps this was the case before I dunno) that the incantation:
        <pre>./AAXtoMP3 --authcode &lt;activation bytes&gt; &lt;location of the *.aax file&gt;</pre>
        &hellip; has to be prefixed with <tt>sudo</tt>.
