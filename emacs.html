<li>how to disable ALT key hijacking in Unity when working with Emacs</li>
Follow <a href="http://askubuntu.com/a/455531">these instructions</a>.
<li>how to load a module in Emacs and associate it with a file extension</li>
It is a three-step process:
    <ol>
        <li>extend the <tt>load-path</tt> to include the directory where the <tt>*.el</tt> file for the mode lives</li>
        <li>load the module</li>
        <li>associate the module with the file extension</li>
    </ol>
This is nicely shown in the below excrept from my <tt>.emacs</tt> file:
<pre>
(progn
    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/web-mode/")
    (load "web-mode")
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.html\\'" . web-mode))
)
</pre>
It is advisable that that the <tt>el</tt> file lives in a <a href="git.html#submodules">git submodule</a>.
<li>how to view the value of a variable in Emacs</li>
Use the function <code>describe-variable</code> (usually bound to <tt>C-h v</tt>)
<li>replace tabs / spaces in Emacs</li>
The way to do it is via <b>M-x tabify</b> or <b>M-x untabify</b>.
These functions work on the current selection, so to apply them to
the whole buffer do a <b>C-x h</b> beforehand.
<li>how to install Emacs24 on Ubuntu</li>
I followed the instructions found here:<p>

<a href="https://launchpad.net/~cassou/+archive/emacs">
         https://launchpad.net/~cassou/+archive/emacs
</a>
<p>
(I got there from:<p>
   <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/149562/how-to-upgrade-to-emacs-24-1">
            http://askubuntu.com/questions/149562/how-to-upgrade-to-emacs-24-1
   </a>
)
<p>
Be sure to also read the instructions in the link of the "Signing key".
After the "sudo apt-get update" I then did a "sudo apt-get install emacs24"
and had Emacs 24 installed.
<p>
================================================================
<p>
Before succeeding I tried following these instructions instead:
<p>
<a href="http://batsov.com/articles/2011/10/09/getting-started-with-emacs-24/">
         http://batsov.com/articles/2011/10/09/getting-started-with-emacs-24/
</a>
<p>
(which points you to:
 <a href="http://emacs.naquadah.org/">
    http://emacs.naquadah.org/
 </a>
)
<p>
  but it didn't work. The reason was that I was being silly because the link at http:emacs.naquadah.org ALSO points to Damien Cassou's page (it says: "If you are looking for the Ubuntu packages, Damien Cassou now maintains an emacs-snapshot PPA.") but I was tired and my eyes were sore and didn't notice it.
