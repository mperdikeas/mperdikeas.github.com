        <li><b>2019, November</b>: how I installed Emacs 25 on Ubuntu 16.04</li>
        <p>
          Following the instructions from <a href='http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2017/04/install-emacs-25-ppa-ubuntu-16-04-14-04/'>here</a>
          I did the following:
          <pre>
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kelleyk/emacs
sudo apt install emacs25
$ emacs --version | head -1
GNU Emacs 24.5.1
$ emacs25 --version | head -1
GNU Emacs 25.3.2</pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          Subsequently, I configured alternatives for <b>emacs</b>:
          <pre>
$ sudo update-alternatives --config emacs
[sudo] password for mperdikeas:
There are 2 choices for the alternative emacs (providing /usr/bin/emacs).

  Selection    Path                Priority   Status
------------------------------------------------------------
* 0            /usr/bin/emacs24-x   27        auto mode
  1            /usr/bin/emacs24-x   27        manual mode
  2            /usr/bin/emacs25     27        manual mode

Press &lt;enter&gt; to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number: 2
            update-alternatives: using /usr/bin/emacs25 to provide /usr/bin/emacs (emacs) in manual mode

        <li>how to rebuild ELPA packages</li>
        <p>
          <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/a/24735377/274677'>source</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          I have encountered cases where an emacs installation would behave erratically with certain key-bindings
          not working as expected given the packages I've installed. This could be due to an Emacs upgrade and the
          ELPA packages requiring rebuilding.
        </p>
        <p>Based on the source link above (and given that my <tt>package-user-dir</tt> variable was apparently
          not set), I've used the following:
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>M-: (byte-recompile-directory package-user-dir nil 'force)</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          &hellip; to rebuild the packages. When I re-launced Emacs things seemed to be working more smoothly.
        </p>
        <p>
          If, for some weird reason the <tt>package-user-dir</tt> variable is not set (use <tt>C-h v</tt> to inspect it)
          you can also provide the directory as a string literal:
          <br>
          <code>M-: (byte-recompile-directory package-user-dir "/home/mperdikeas/.emacs.d/elpa" nil 'force)</code>
        </p> 
        <p>
          BTW, <tt>M-:</tt> can be used to evaluate any expression in the minibuffer.
        <li>key information</li>
        <p>
          <code>C-h k</code>
        </p>
        &hellip; followed by an arbitrary key sequence shows which command is mapped to that key sequence.
        <li>mode information</li>
        <dl>
          <dt><code>C-h m</code></dt><dd>to get information about major and minor modes</dd>
        </dl>
        <dt><code>C-h f json-mode</code></dt><dd>to get information about a particular mode</dd>
        <br/>

        and a link to the file that defines.
        <li>solve the dreaded <code>C-SPACE</code> sequence key not working in emacs</li>
        <p><i>I was beset by this problem when I installed Emacs24 on Ubuntu 14.04.5 on the Dell Precision
          laptop (August '16)
        </i></p>
        <p>Basically what happens is that the <code>C-SPACE</code> combo is hijacked by the <code>ibus</code> program and not recognized as a sequence in Emacs. When you <tt>ssh</tt> to the computer from another
          machine that doesn't suffer from this problem the combo works as expected (this proves that the problem
          is not in Emacs but rather in the desktop environment).
        </p>
        <p>Follow <a href='http://askubuntu.com/q/243639'>these instructions</a>.</p>
        <p>Core of the solution:
          <quote>
            <p>In 14.04, you can edit the settings directly is <code>dconf-editor</code>.</p>
            <p>If it is not installed:
              <pre>sudo apt install dconf-editor</pre>
            </p>
            <p>
              Then browse to Desktop >> ibus >> general >> hotkey. The trigger and triggers setting will still show 'control+space'. Edit these settings out, being careful to leave empty brackets [] in triggers.

        <li>solve the dreaded <code>M-<RET></code> problem in Org-mode on tty</li>
          Use <a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/TTY-keys.html#TTY-keys">these alternative key bindings</a>
          as suggested in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/6808124/274677">this answer</a>.
          <li>how to disable ALT key hijacking in Unity when working with Emacs</li>
          Follow <a href="http://askubuntu.com/a/455531">these instructions</a>.
          <p>
            Basically install <code>ccsm</code> (CompizConfig Settings Manager):
            <pre>
sudo apt-get install CompizConfig-Settings-Manager.
            </pre>
            &hellip; then run <code>ccsm</code> and select Desktop / Ubuntu Unity Plugin and disable the "Key to show the menu bar while pressed" and possibly "Key to show the HUD when tapped" too.
          </p>
          <p>
            Basically disable everything bound to the <code>ALT</code> key to be on the safe side.

          <li>how to load a module in Emacs and associate it with a file extension</li>
          It is a three-step process:
          <ol>
            <li>extend the <tt>load-path</tt> to include the directory where the <tt>*.el</tt> file for the mode lives</li>
            <li>load the module</li>
            <li>associate the module with the file extension</li>
          </ol>
          This is nicely shown in the below excrept from my <tt>.emacs</tt> file:
          <pre>
(progn
    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/web-mode/")
    (load "web-mode")
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.html\\'" . web-mode))
)
          </pre>
          It is advisable that that the <tt>el</tt> file lives in a <a href="git.html#submodules">git submodule</a>.
          <li>how to view the value of a variable in Emacs</li>
          Use the function <code>describe-variable</code> (usually bound to <tt>C-h v</tt>)
          <li>replace tabs / spaces in Emacs</li>
          The way to do it is via <b>M-x tabify</b> or <b>M-x untabify</b>.
          These functions work on the current selection, so to apply them to
          the whole buffer do a <b>C-x h</b> beforehand.

              After the "sudo apt-get update" I then did a "sudo apt-get install emacs24"
              and had Emacs 24 installed.

            <p>
              Before succeeding I tried following these instructions instead:

              </a>
            </p>
            <p>
              (which points you to:
              <a href="http://emacs.naquadah.org/">
                http://emacs.naquadah.org/
              </a>
              )
            </p>
            <p>
              but it didn't work. The reason was that I was being silly because the link at http:emacs.naquadah.org ALSO points to Damien Cassou's page (it says: "If you are looking for the Ubuntu packages, Damien Cassou now maintains an emacs-snapshot PPA.") but I was tired and my eyes were sore and didn't notice it.
