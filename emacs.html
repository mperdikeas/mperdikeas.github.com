        <li><b>2024, November</b>: successful installation of Emacs 29 (Ubuntu 20.04) </li>
        <p>
          After I installed Emacs 28 I became frustrated that <tt>lsp-mode</tt> and the overall machinery I used
          to get TypeScript IntelliSense in Emacs was too slow, so I thought I might try to upgrade to Emacs 29.
          Installing Emacs 29 wasn't possible as apparently it's only available as a <i>snap</i>. I initially
          found <a href='https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/73857/4003'>this emacs stackexchange answer</a>
          and was then led to <a href='https://snapcraft.io/install/emacs/ubuntu'>these instructions</a>.
          Installing Emacs 29 was only a matter of doing:
          <pre>sudo snap install emacs --classic</pre>
          and modifying my <tt>~/.bashrc</tt> to place the <tt>/snap/bin</tt> directory at the front of
          the <i>PATH</i> to ensure that <tt>emacs</tt>
          on the shell picks <i>Emacs 29</i> and not <i>Emacs 28</i> (which was installed with <tt>apt</tt>)
        </p>
        <p>
          Following the installation I just removed a number of packages that were no longer available
          (nor, it would seem, relevant as nothing was affected following their removal), moved the
          main package installation block at the head of my <tt>.emacs</tt> file and started off with a
          clean <tt>.emacs.d</tt> directory. Everything went surprisingly smoothly.
        </p>
        <li><b>2024, November</b>: successful installation of Emacs 28 (Ubuntu 20.04) </li>
        <p>
          Following a previous disastrous attempt to install Emacs 27 in my ThinkStation desktop
          (running Ubuntu 20.04) I tried again the next day and succeeded to actually install
          Emacs 28 instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          I followed the instructions from
          <a href='https://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2020/09/install-emacs-27-1-ppa-ubuntu-20-04/'>here</a>
          (which are pretty much what I tried the previous day); only this time I thoroughly uninstalled
          Emacs 26 alongside a number of extra packages using the following incantation:
          <pre>
sudo apt remove emacs26-common emacs26 emacs-common emacs apel flim w3m-el emacs-el emacs-bin-common</pre>
          &hellip; as advised in a comment in the above linked instructions that reads:

<br/>
sudo apt remove emacs26-common emacs26 emacs-common emacs apel flim w3m-el emacs-el emacs-bin-common<br/>
<br/>
After that, I could finally do sudo apt install emacs27 and it worked.<br/>
<br/>
It also had to re-download all of my packages on the first run, so the first run was especially slow.<br/>
<br/>
But now, everythingâ€™s fine.<br/>
          </i>
          </div>
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed following the above instructions <tt>sudo apt install emacs28</tt> worked like a charm
          with zero complaints or warnings; not only that but my configuration files (developed and
          tested for Emacs 26) also worked <u>right off the bat</u> with <b>zero</b> modifications
          needed. This was, by a wide margin, the most uneventful Emacs upgrade ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          For completeness purposes, this is the history (slightly edited) in the terminal from where I performed the installation:
          <pre>
 $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kelleyk/emacs
 $ apt update
 $ sudo apt remove emacs26-common emacs26 emacs-common emacs apel flim w3m-el emacs-el emacs-bin-common
 $ sudo apt install emacs28</pre>
          Note finally that I did try to install the very latest Emacs 29 also but apparently it is
          not available in the <tt>ppa:kellyk/emacs</tt> repository. Well, no matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will now try to refresh the Emacs packages and see whether I can finally succeed in
          installing IntelliSense for TypeScript in my Emacs 28.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h3>follow-up</h3>
          While trying to refresh the package implementations, it turned out that I
          also had to remove the <tt>crosshairs</tt> package from my <tt>.emacs</tt> file as that
          package does not support versions of Emacs beyond 26. During the package refresh
          process I also had to do <tt>(setq package-check-signature nil)</tt> &mdash; this dangerous line is currently
          commented-out at the head of my <tt>.emacs</tt> file. Note that I think that the package
          refresh process wasn't triggered until I removed the <tt>.emacs.d</tt> directory from my
          home directory. At the same time I decided that it makes little or zero sense to keep
          the <tt>.emacs.d</tt> directory under git source control.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, unrelated to the previous package refreshing issues, I had to fix my <tt>emax</tt>
          script that handles multiple Emacs clients out of a single Emacs server. The fix consisted
          of a minor <tt>grep</tt> adjustment.

        <li><b>2024, November</b>: failure to install Emacs 27 and Language Server on Ubuntu 20.04</li>
        <p>
          In November 2024 I spent about 5 hours trying to install Emacs 27 on Ubuntu 20.04. In the end I failed.
          Large part of the time spent was in trying to restore Emacs 26.3 (which is what Ubuntu 20.04 supports
          officially).
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of the same travail I failed to install <tt>lsp-mode</tt> (so as to have TypeScript language server
          facilities and IntelliSense in Emacs); it was verified that <i>Emacs 27.1</i> is required.
          I was following instructions from <a href='https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/tutorials/reactjs-tutorial/'>here</a>.

        <li>how to rebuild ELPA packages</li>
        <p>
          <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/a/24735377/274677'>source</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          I have encountered cases where an emacs installation would behave erratically with certain key-bindings
          not working as expected given the packages I've installed. This could be due to an Emacs upgrade and the
          ELPA packages requiring rebuilding.
        </p>
        <p>Based on the source link above (and given that my <tt>package-user-dir</tt> variable was apparently
          not set), I've used the following:
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>M-: (byte-recompile-directory package-user-dir nil 'force)</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          &hellip; to rebuild the packages. When I re-launced Emacs things seemed to be working more smoothly.
        </p>
        <p>
          If, for some weird reason the <tt>package-user-dir</tt> variable is not set (use <tt>C-h v</tt> to inspect it)
          you can also provide the directory as a string literal:
          <br>
          <code>M-: (byte-recompile-directory package-user-dir "/home/mperdikeas/.emacs.d/elpa" nil 'force)</code>
        </p> 
        <p>
          BTW, <tt>M-:</tt> can be used to evaluate any expression in the minibuffer.
        <li>key information</li>
        <p>
          <code>C-h k</code>
        </p>
        &hellip; followed by an arbitrary key sequence shows which command is mapped to that key sequence.
        <li>mode information</li>
        <dl>
          <dt><code>C-h m</code></dt><dd>to get information about major and minor modes</dd>
        </dl>
        <dt><code>C-h f json-mode</code></dt><dd>to get information about a particular mode</dd>
        <br/>

        and a link to the file that defines.
        <li>solve the dreaded <code>C-SPACE</code> sequence key not working in emacs</li>
        <p><i>I was beset by this problem when I installed Emacs24 on Ubuntu 14.04.5 on the Dell Precision
          laptop (August '16)
        </i></p>
        <p>Basically what happens is that the <code>C-SPACE</code> combo is hijacked by the <code>ibus</code> program and not recognized as a sequence in Emacs. When you <tt>ssh</tt> to the computer from another
          machine that doesn't suffer from this problem the combo works as expected (this proves that the problem
          is not in Emacs but rather in the desktop environment).

        <p>Core of the solution:
          <quote>
            <p>In 14.04, you can edit the settings directly is <code>dconf-editor</code>.</p>
            <p>If it is not installed:
              <pre>sudo apt install dconf-editor</pre>
            </p>
            <p>
              Then browse to Desktop >> ibus >> general >> hotkey. The trigger and triggers setting will still show 'control+space'. Edit these settings out, being careful to leave empty brackets [] in triggers.

            Basically install <code>ccsm</code> (CompizConfig Settings Manager):
            <pre>
sudo apt-get install CompizConfig-Settings-Manager.
            </pre>
            &hellip; then run <code>ccsm</code> and select Desktop / Ubuntu Unity Plugin and disable the "Key to show the menu bar while pressed" and possibly "Key to show the HUD when tapped" too.
          </p>
          <p>
            Basically disable everything bound to the <code>ALT</code> key to be on the safe side.

          <li>how to load a module in Emacs and associate it with a file extension</li>
          It is a three-step process:
          <ol>
            <li>extend the <tt>load-path</tt> to include the directory where the <tt>*.el</tt> file for the mode lives</li>
            <li>load the module</li>
            <li>associate the module with the file extension</li>
          </ol>
          This is nicely shown in the below excrept from my <tt>.emacs</tt> file:
          <pre>
(progn
    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/web-mode/")
    (load "web-mode")
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.html\\'" . web-mode))
)
          </pre>
          It is advisable that that the <tt>el</tt> file lives in a <a href="git.html#submodules">git submodule</a>.
          <li>how to view the value of a variable in Emacs</li>
          Use the function <code>describe-variable</code> (usually bound to <tt>C-h v</tt>)
          <li>replace tabs / spaces in Emacs</li>
          The way to do it is via <b>M-x tabify</b> or <b>M-x untabify</b>.
          These functions work on the current selection, so to apply them to
          the whole buffer do a <b>C-x h</b> beforehand.
