        <li><a href='http://infocenter.sybase.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.sybase.infocenter.dc01672.1570/html/sec_admin/X11284.htm'>
        ASE 15.7 SP 100 - Security Administration Guide - Chapter 3: Managing Adaptive Server Logins and Database Users</a></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      When a new user needs to connect to a SQL Server, the first thing
      that needs to be done is for the Security Officer (SO) to create a new "login account".
      The login is at the level of the server as a whole, and is not tied
      to a particular database (even though some default database may
      optionally be chosen so that the user doesn't have to type <tt>'use &lt;dbname&gt;'</tt>once he's in.
    </p>
    <p>It follows therefore, that the login name chosen by the SO
      must be unique. This name is also known as "Server User Name"
      and is not to be confused with the DB-specific usernames.
      Once the SO executes the <b><tt>create login</tt></b>
      command, a new row is added in the <b><tt>master.dbo.syslogins</tt></b>
      table. This row includes:
      <ul>
        <li>the login name (a.k.a. server user name &mdash; not to be confused with the database-specific usernames)</li>
        <li>the unique Server User ID (suid) for the new user</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Subsequently, when a DataBase Owner (DBO) or System Administrator (SA)
      can use <tt><b>sp_adduser</b></tt> to add a login account to a specific
      database (<a href='http://infocenter.sybase.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.sybase.infocenter.dc01672.1572/html/sec_admin/BCFIJEEG.htm'>source</a>).
      At that point, the DBO or SA can optionally assign a "name_in_db"
      which maybe different than the login name and by which the user will
      be known inside that particular database. Otherwise the username in
      the database will be the user's login name. The <tt>sp_adduser</tt> SP
      adds a row in the <tt><b>sysusers</b></tt> system table in that
      database. When a user has an entry in the <tt>sysusers</tt> table
      of a database he can issue <tt>use <i>database_name</i></tt> to
      access that database.

    <li>ANSI treatment of NULL values in comparisons</li>
    <p>
      Sybase as well as the equally abominable SQL Server don't treat NULLs according to the ANSI SQL standard by default. In Sybase, you'd have to explicitly set the <tt>ansinull</tt> setting to make sure you have a sound environment. This can be set on a connection basis but I suppose the default can also be configured globally somehow.
    </p>

    <li id='schemas-and-sybase-table-access-notation'>Schemas, users and the <tt>dbname.username.tablename</tt> notation</li>
    <p>
      Sybase ASE does not have a proper schema concept. Instead it conflates the concept of a user with that of the schema. Tables are thought to be owned by the user who created them. See e.g. <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/a/34725708/274677'>this SO answer</a> on the topic where we read:
      <blockquote>
Sybase ASE does not use the schema concept that SQL Server and Oracle use. Objects are located inside a database, and owned by a user - no other logical separations are there.        
      </blockquote>
      <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/a/35063370/274677'>This SO answer</a> is also pertinent, where we read:
      <blockquote>
        Oracle (and Microsoft) use a schema logical construct that Sybase ASE does not. In SAP/Sybase ASE, all tables and columns in a database are in the same schema. It is possible to users to have their own objects in the database though, so there is the possibility of imitating some of the schema behavior using user ownership, but it would require an extra level of effort.
      </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
      As such the notation <tt>dbname.username.tablename</tt> is used with the meaning "<i>table <tt>tablename</tt> owned by user <tt>username</tt> in the database <tt>dbname</tt></i>"
    </p>
    <p>This being said, since it is possible for different user to have different tables with the exact same name in the same database, this concept does allow one to user usernames as namespaces for tables much as the schemas are used in PostgreSQL to provide a namespace for table names.</p>
    <p>However, this is not the established convention. Instead, the established convention is the following:
      <ul>
        <li>all objects (tables, views, stored procedures) are owned by the database owner (that's the user <i>dbo</i>)</li>
        <li>users do not own any objects <b>at all</b>, &hellip;</li>
        <li>&hellip;instead the <i>dbo</i> user owns everything and grants to the users permissions to read or update the various tables, call the various stored procedures etc.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>This is ostensibly done so that when a user is fired, you don't have to rename their tables. IMO this doesn' make much sense as there's nothing that says that the users of a database have to correspond to physical persons.</p>
    <p>OTOH and in defence of Sybase it has to be said that since it is possible to have Foreign Key constraints across databases (in the same server obviously), then the concept of the database itself functions like the namespace for tables. Instead, in PostgreSQL, last time I used it (2015), it wasn't possible to have FK constraints across databases so the schema concept was indispensable. Still that's not quite the same thing as you have to create the same user on multiple databases if your application needs to access a bunch of different databases (which is very often the case).</p>
    <p>At any rate and coming back to the <tt>dbname.username.tablename</tt> notation, either or both of the <i>dbname</i> and <i>username</i> components may be missing:
      <ul>
        <li>If the <i>dbname</i> component is missing then it is assumed to be the database currently used by the connection</li>
        <li>If the <i>username</i> component is missing then it is assumed to be the user that's logged-in on the current connection. However, if that user owns no tables (which is what the established convention is), then Sybase falls back to the <i>dbo</i> user and looks there for a table named <i>tablename</i>. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>See also this <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/q/46942914/274677'>SO question of mine</a> and this <a href='#sybase-ase-concepts'>older note of mine</a>.</p>

    </p>
    <p>
      To show all currently logged-in users and information about their connections (e.g. client host name, database name, command) use the system stored procedure <code>sp_who</code>. E.g. from <i>sqsh</i>:

    <p><a href='https://dba.stackexchange.com/a/69733/34332'>source</a></p>
    <p>
    Sybase Servers support the use of date and time data through the datetime and smalldatetime datatypes (and, with newer server, the date and time datatypes), as well as the getdate(), dateadd(), datediff(), and datepart() functions. The getutcdate() function was also added to some servers to provide the current datetime value in Coordinated Universal Time regardless of the time zone the server is otherwise running under.
    </p>
    <p>
      The datetime and smalldatetime datatypes, however, do not store time zone information and the products are entirely ignorant of the concepts of time zones and daylight saving time. Sybase Servers only recognize and store the date and time portions of the values provided by the operating system, which are based on the time zone configured at the operating system level (typically though the TZ environment variable setting in Unix or the Date/Time function of the Windows Control Panel) for the user who started the product. The calculations behind the dateadd and datediff functions are aware of leap years (using the rule of every 4th year, except for every 100th year, except for every 400th year), but do not include any adjustments for leap seconds or transitions from daylight saving time to regular time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore changing the underlying OS timezone will not have any appreciable effect on the data stored in the datetime fields in one's database.
    </p>
    <p>Also, the implication of the above is that looking at the <tt>DATETIME</tt> values in a Sybase database you don't know the exact time unless you also know the timezone of the server!</p>

    <p>System procedures such as <tt>sp_procxmode</tt> are stored in database <tt>sybsystemprocs</tt>.

      <blockquote style='font-size: 90%;}'>

        </p>
        <p>
          Some system procedures can be run only in a specific database, but many of them can be run in any database. You can create your own system procedures that can be executed from any database. For more information, see the <i>System Administration Guide</i>.

    <pre>SELECT @@TRANCOUNT</pre>
    A value of `0` signifies that we are not inside a transaction. In case of nested transactions
    Sybase actually commits a transaction if a `commit` is given at level `1` only. Commits in levels
    greater than `1` simply reduce the transaction depth by one. A commit on level `1` reduces
    the depth to `0` and it is only at that point that Sybase commits the transaction.
    <li>show connected users</li>
    The below (in sqsh) will show all users connected to database <i>somedatabase</i> together
    with the header row for additional information:
    <pre>sp_who; | grep 'somedatabase\|threadpool'</pre>
    <li>show a table's constraints (e.g. foreign keys)</li>
    In sqsh:
    <pre>

    &hellip; the above will show all foreign keys both originating from this table and
    pointing to this table.
    <li>Sybase Datetime to Unix epoch</li>
    <p>
      Note first of all that Sybase is totally oblivious to time zones. It
      stores no time zone iformation at all. The server simply stores
      whatever <tt>Datetime</tt> values the client provides without applying any
      kind of transformation. It also reports the stored values without any
      kind of transformation. So the onus is on the client application to not
      mess up. Also, in case different application access
      the same server, they should all be aware of each other's conventions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only case I am aware of, of the server reporting a <tt>Datetime</tt>
      value that was not previously provided by the client, is with the
      <tt>getDate</tt> function:
      <pre>select getDate()</pre>
    </p>
    <p>&hellip; in this case I've verified that the server's behavior is
      identical to simply returning the date value provided by Linux (e.g.
      using <tt>date</tt>)
      <b>totally ignoring</b> the timestamp information. 
    </p>
    <p>I am not aware of a method to inquire a Sybase server as to the time zone
      it is located (e.g. what you get in Unix with <code>date +%z</code> or
      <code>date +%Z</code>). This is equivalent as saying that it is impossible
      to ask a Sybase server to return the time in seconds since the epoch (what
      you get with <code>date +%s</code> in Bash).
    </p>
    <p>With the above caveats in mind, below are the functions to convert
      between Unix epoch values and <tt>Datetime</tt> values in Sybase:
      <dl>
        <dt>Unix Epoch to Datetime</dt>
        <dd><pre>SELECT dateadd( SECOND, 1489426961, '1970-1-1' )</pre></dd>
        <dt>Datetime to Unix Epoch</dt>
        <dd><pre>SELECT datediff( SECOND, '1970-1-1', getDate())</pre></dd>
        <dt>Invariant (sanity check)</dt>
        <dd><pre>SELECT datediff (SECOND, '1970-1-1', dateadd( SECOND, 42, '1970-1-1' ))</pre></dd>
      </dl>
      &hellip; given the caveats noted above, the conversion functions above
      (except the invariant) will return correct values only if the server is
      in UTC (which is where the Unix Epoch is defined). The invariant however
      works in all cases as the effects of the two transformations cancel each
      other out (so the invariant always returns <tt>42</tt>).
       </p>
       <p>Finally, just to note that some useful Sybase <tt>Datetime</tt> to
         String </tt>conversion formats are defined under path <i>Transact-SQL Users Guide &gt; Using Transact-SQL Functions in Queries &gt; Built-in functions</i>.
         I am not providing a link as the Sybase shitty company can't even implement bookmarkable documentation.

    <li>on the precision of the <code>datetime</code> datatype in Sybase (and SQL Server)</li>
    <p>
      The <code>datetime</code> data type in Sybase (this applies to SQL Server as well), is able to only distinguish time in (approximately) 1/300ths of a second. No greater resolution is possible. Contrast that with glorious
      PostgreSQL which has microsecond resolution for a <a href='https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/datatype-datetime.html'>huge range of dates</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is corroborated by the fact that the following query, when executed on
      a table with more than 1000 <code>datetime</code> values, yields only 237
      distinct millisecond values:
      <pre>
 SELECT COUNT(*) FROM
 (
 SELECT DISTINCT y.millis FROM
 (
 SELECT RIGHT(RTRIM(LTRIM(x.submissionDate)), 6) AS millis FROM (
 SELECT convert(char(32), submission_date, 139) AS submissionDate FROM proposal..proposal
 ) x
 ) y
 ) z</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      So, the bottom line is that when using a client-side API such as JDBC,
      the <a href='http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html?java/sql/Timestamp.html'>java.sql.Timestamp</a>
      (which can hold an exact date up to <b>nanosecond</b> precision) is way more
      than enough to accurately convey to the client side any value stored in a
      <code>datetime</code> column.
    </p>
    <p>Conversely, it also means that the <code>datetime</code> data type is
      inadequate to hold all possible values of a <code>java.sql.Timestamp</code>
      or indeed, even of the much humbler <a href='http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Date.html'>java.util.Date</a> which has millisecond resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wretched Sybase documentation imprecisely states that the <code>datetime</code> data type can hold values accurate to <i>1/300 second</i>. This is misleading.
      What they actually mean is that the resolution / granularity / precision (pick your favorite term) of
      the <code>datetime</code> data type is approximately 3 ms.

    <li>tips on how to use <tt>sqsh</tt> effectively in interactive mode</li>
    For some weird reason the output of many <tt>sqsh</tt> commands (either <tt>SELECT</tt> statements
    or stored procedures) is very wide and folds or generates line breaks that interfere with piping
    operations and stuff like <tt>cut</tt> or <tt>awk</tt> (that are possible in <tt>sqsh</tt>). To combat that:
    <ul>
      <li>use the <tt>-J</tt> switch to select the <tt>iso_1</tt> character set. For some reason, that results
        in denser output. E.g.:<pre>sqsh -Jiso_1 -Umperdike -Ssqldev</pre>
        <li>Append, after a <tt>SQL</tt> statement or the call to a stored procedure <tt>-mbcp</tt>. This
          will result in pipe-separated output which is denser. E.g.:
          <pre>select * from sysobjects; -mbcp</pre> &hellip; or:
          <pre>sp_ls; -mbcp</pre>
        </li>
    </ul>
        
    <li>tips on how to use <tt>sqsh</tt> effectively when running scripts in batch mode</li>
    <ul>
      <li><p>
        the <b style='font-size:110%'><tt>-h</tt></b> option turns off column headers and trailers. E.g. stuff like "<i>(#rows affected)</i>" or "<i>(return status=0)</i>" &mdash; but sadly not <i>"Type added"</i> messages.
        </p>
        <p>
        Sample invocation:
          <pre>sqsh -h -Uusername -Sdbname -i script-dml.sql</pre>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>the <b style='font-size:110%'><tt>-a</tt></b> option supposedly is the maximum number of errors before aborting but I 've tried
        that with 0 and 1 and it didn't seem to work (I got the impression that the script carried on)
      <li>the <b style='font-size:110%'><tt>-e</tt></b> option allows you to echo each line that <tt>sqsh</tt> executes. In this way when
        something breaks you'll be able to see the approximate point where the breakage happened. Example invocation:
        <pre>sqsh -e -Uusername -SdatabaseName -i script-ddl.sql </pre></li>
    </ul>
    <li>The interesting table <tt>sysobjects</tt></li>

    <p>To verify that table <tt>sysobjects</tt> is among the system tables
      in a database do:
<pre>select name from sysobjects where type='S'</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      To view all user tables in a database do:
      <pre>select name from sysobjects where type='U'</pre>
      &hellip; this is the same set returned with <code>sp_ls</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      To view all stored procedures in some other database 'foo' that have the string 'person' in their name do:
      <pre>select type, name from foo..sysobjects where type='P'; | grep person</pre>

      In ASE, there is no concept of a "schema" (like you have in PostgreSQL or Oracle), instead tables are owned by users.
      So, hierarchically, the concepts of database server, database, user and table are arranged as follows:

      An ASE database server (single OS process with a single listening port) contains multiple databases, some of which
      are "system" databases and the rest are "user" databases (e.g. in the CfA environment these would
      be <i>cxcaccounts</i>, <i>axafusers</i> and about 40 others). Two system databases that are always present in an
      ASE system are:
      <ul>
        <li>master</li>
        <li>sybsystemprocs</li>
      </ul>
      The database server may also be known by a database name (alias)
      that's used by tools like <tt>sqsh</tt> to connect to it. In the CfA environment the configurations are kept
      in file:
      <code>/soft/SYBASE15.7/interfaces</code>
