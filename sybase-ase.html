    <li>Sybase attrocious handling of time</li>
    <p><a href='https://dba.stackexchange.com/a/69733/34332'>source</a></p>
    <p>
    Sybase Servers support the use of date and time data through the datetime and smalldatetime datatypes (and, with newer server, the date and time datatypes), as well as the getdate(), dateadd(), datediff(), and datepart() functions. The getutcdate() function was also added to some servers to provide the current datetime value in Coordinated Universal Time regardless of the time zone the server is otherwise running under.
    </p>
    <p>
      The datetime and smalldatetime datatypes, however, do not store time zone information and the products are entirely ignorant of the concepts of time zones and daylight saving time. Sybase Servers only recognize and store the date and time portions of the values provided by the operating system, which are based on the time zone configured at the operating system level (typically though the TZ environment variable setting in Unix or the Date/Time function of the Windows Control Panel) for the user who started the product. The calculations behind the dateadd and datediff functions are aware of leap years (using the rule of every 4th year, except for every 100th year, except for every 400th year), but do not include any adjustments for leap seconds or transitions from daylight saving time to regular time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore changing the underlying OS timezone will not have any appreciable effect on the data stored in the datetime fields in one's database.
    </p>
    <p>Also, the implication of the above is that looking at the <tt>DATETIME</tt> values in a Sybase database you don't know the exact time unless you also know the timezone of the server!</p>

    <p>System procedures such as <tt>sp_procxmode</tt> are stored in database <tt>sybsystemprocs</tt>.
    </p>
    <p>The documentation says (the link does not appear very trustworthy):
      <blockquote style='font-size: 90%;}'>
        <p>
        System procedures are created by <b>installmaster</b> at installation. They are located in the <i>sybsystemprocs</i> database, and owned by the system administrator. Use <b>sp_version</b> to determine which version of <i>installmaster</i> was most recently run.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some system procedures can be run only in a specific database, but many of them can be run in any database. You can create your own system procedures that can be executed from any database. For more information, see the <i>System Administration Guide</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
        All system procedures execute at isolation level 1.
        </p>
        <p>
        All system procedures report a return status. The following example means that the procedure executed successfully:
<tt>return status = 0</tt>
        </p>
        <p>
          Beginning with Adaptive Server® version 12.5.1, you can declare up to 10,000 variables in a stored procedure. In earlier versions of Adaptive Server, the limit was 2,000.

    <pre>SELECT @@TRANCOUNT</pre>
    A value of `0` signifies that we are not inside a transaction. In case of nested transactions
    Sybase actually commits a transaction if a `commit` is given at level `1` only. Commits in levels
    greater than `1` simply reduce the transaction depth by one. A commit on level `1` reduces
    the depth to `0` and it is only at that point that Sybase commits the transaction.
    <li>show connected users</li>
    The below (in sqsh) will show all users connected to database <i>somedatabase</i> together

    In sqsh:
    <pre>
sp_helpconstraint &lt;table-name&gt;;</pre>
    <li>Sybase Datetime to Unix epoch</li>
    <p>
      Note first of all that Sybase is totally oblivious to time zones. It
      stores no time zone iformation at all. The server simply stores
      whatever <tt>Datetime</tt> values the client provides without applying any
      kind of transformation. It also reports the stored values without any
      kind of transformation. So the onus is on the client application to not
      mess up. Also, in case different application access
      the same server, they should all be aware of each other's conventions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only case I am aware of, of the server reporting a <tt>Datetime</tt>
      value that was not previously provided by the client, is with the
      <tt>getDate</tt> function:
      <pre>select getDate()</pre>
    </p>
    <p>&hellip; in this case I've verified that the server's behavior is
      identical to simply returning the date value provided by Linux (e.g.
      using <tt>date</tt>)
      <b>totally ignoring</b> the timestamp information. 
    </p>
    <p>I am not aware of a method to inquire a Sybase server as to the time zone
      it is located (e.g. what you get in Unix with <code>date +%z</code> or
      <code>date +%Z</code>). This is equivalent as saying that it is impossible
      to ask a Sybase server to return the time in seconds since the epoch (what
      you get with <code>date +%s</code> in Bash).
    </p>
    <p>With the above caveats in mind, below are the functions to convert
      between Unix epoch values and <tt>Datetime</tt> values in Sybase:
      <dl>
        <dt>Unix Epoch to Datetime</dt>
        <dd><pre>SELECT dateadd( SECOND, 1489426961, '1970-1-1' )</pre></dd>
        <dt>Datetime to Unix Epoch</dt>
        <dd><pre>SELECT datediff( SECOND, '1970-1-1', getDate())</pre></dd>
        <dt>Invariant (sanity check)</dt>
        <dd><pre>SELECT datediff (SECOND, '1970-1-1', dateadd( SECOND, 42, '1970-1-1' ))</pre></dd>
      </dl>
      &hellip; given the caveats noted above, the conversion functions above
      (except the invariant) will return correct values only if the server is
      in UTC (which is where the Unix Epoch is defined). The invariant however
      works in all cases as the effects of the two transformations cancel each
      other out (so the invariant always returns <tt>42</tt>).
       </p>
       <p>Finally, just to note that some useful Sybase <tt>Datetime</tt> to
         String </tt>conversion formats are defined under path <i>Transact-SQL Users Guide &gt; Using Transact-SQL Functions in Queries &gt; Built-in functions</i>.
         I am not providing a link as the Sybase shitty company can't even implement bookmarkable documentation.
       </p>

    <li>on the precision of the <code>datetime</code> datatype in Sybase (and SQL Server)</li>
    <p>
      The <code>datetime</code> data type in Sybase (this applies to SQL Server as well), is able to only distinguish time in (approximately) 1/300ths of a second. No greater resolution is possible. Contrast that with glorious
      PostgreSQL which has microsecond resolution for a <a href='https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/datatype-datetime.html'>huge range of dates</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is corroborated by the fact that the following query, when executed on
      a table with more than 1000 <code>datetime</code> values, yields only 237
      distinct millisecond values:
      <pre>
 SELECT COUNT(*) FROM
 (
 SELECT DISTINCT y.millis FROM
 (
 SELECT RIGHT(RTRIM(LTRIM(x.submissionDate)), 6) AS millis FROM (
 SELECT convert(char(32), submission_date, 139) AS submissionDate FROM proposal..proposal
 ) x
 ) y
 ) z</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      So, the bottom line is that when using a client-side API such as JDBC,
      the <a href='http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html?java/sql/Timestamp.html'>java.sql.Timestamp</a>
      (which can hold an exact date up to <b>nanosecond</b> precision) is way more
      than enough to accurately convey to the client side any value stored in a
      <code>datetime</code> column.
    </p>
    <p>Conversely, it also means that the <code>datetime</code> data type is
      inadequate to hold all possible values of a <code>java.sql.Timestamp</code>
      or indeed, even of the much humbler <a href='http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Date.html'>java.util.Date</a> which has millisecond resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wretched Sybase documentation imprecisely states that the <code>datetime</code> data type can hold values accurate to <i>1/300 second</i>. This is misleading.
      What they actually mean is that the resolution / granularity / precision (pick your favorite term) of
      the <code>datetime</code> data type is approximately 3 ms.

    <li>tips on how to use <tt>sqsh</tt> effectively in interactive mode</li>
    For some weird reason the output of many <tt>sqsh</tt> commands (either <tt>SELECT</tt> statements
    or stored procedures) is very wide and folds or generates line breaks that interfere with piping
    operations and stuff like <tt>cut</tt> or <tt>awk</tt> (that are possible in <tt>sqsh</tt>). To combat that:
    <ul>
      <li>use the <tt>-J</tt> switch to select the <tt>iso_1</tt> character set. For some reason, that results
        in denser output. E.g.:<pre>sqsh -Jiso_1 -Umperdike -Ssqldev</pre>
        <li>Append, after a <tt>SQL</tt> statement or the call to a stored procedure <tt>-mbcp</tt>. This
          will result in pipe-separated output which is denser. E.g.:
          <pre>select * from sysobjects; -mbcp</pre> &hellip; or:
          <pre>sp_ls; -mbcp</pre>
        </li>
    </ul>
        
    <li>tips on how to use <tt>sqsh</tt> effectively when running scripts in batch mode</li>
    <ul>
      <li><p>
        the <b style='font-size:110%'><tt>-h</tt></b> option turns off column headers and trailers. E.g. stuff like "<i>(#rows affected)</i>" or "<i>(return status=0)</i>" &mdash; but sadly not <i>"Type added"</i> messages.
        </p>
        <p>
        Sample invocation:
          <pre>sqsh -h -Uusername -Sdbname -i script-dml.sql</pre>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>the <b style='font-size:110%'><tt>-a</tt></b> option supposedly is the maximum number of errors before aborting but I 've tried
        that with 0 and 1 and it didn't seem to work (I got the impression that the script carried on)
      <li>the <b style='font-size:110%'><tt>-e</tt></b> option allows you to echo each line that <tt>sqsh</tt> executes. In this way when
        something breaks you'll be able to see the approximate point where the breakage happened. Example invocation:

    <li>Sybase ASE concepts</li>
    <p>
      In ASE, there is no concept of a "schema" (like you have in PostgreSQL or Oracle), instead tables are owned by users.
      So, hierarchically, the concepts of database server, database, user and table are arranged as follows:
    </p>
    <img  src="sybase-ase.html.files/ase-concepts.png"/>
    <p>Referential integrity constraints <b>can</b> cross databases.</p>
    <p>
      Once connected to a Sybase server (e.g. by means of the <tt>sqsh</tt> tool) you can use either of the below forms to
      access a table:
      <dl class='one-line one-line-20-80'>
        <dt>database.owner.table</dt><dd>this is the fully qualified form, e.g. <code>SELECT * FROM cxcaccounts.dbo.a</code> where:
          <dl class='one-line one-line-25-75'>
            <dt>cxcaccounts</dt><dd>is the database name</dd>
            <dt>dbo</dt><dd>is the user&mdash;not the login ('dbo' stands for Database Owner)</dd>
            <dt>a</dt><dd>is the table name</dd>
          </dl>
        </dd>
        <dt>database..table</dt><dd>E.g. <code>SELECT * FROM cxcaccounts..a</code> where the two dots <code>..</code> stand for the owner of that table (or the default owner / usename&mdash;this is not very clear at the moment)
        <dt>..table</dt><dd>&hellip;where the omitted database name is taken to be the default database (I think)</dd>

    <li>Sybase ASE server structure</li>
    <p>
      See also <a href='http://dba.stackexchange.com/q/161470/34332'>this dba.stackexchange question of mine</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      An ASE database server (single OS process with a single listening port) contains multiple databases, some of which
      are "system" databases and the rest are "user" databases (e.g. in the CfA environment these would
      be <i>cxcaccounts</i>, <i>axafusers</i> and about 40 others). Two system databases that are always present in an
      ASE system are:
      <ul>
        <li>master</li>
        <li>sybsystemprocs</li>
      </ul>
      The database server may also be known by a database name
      that's used by tools like <tt>sqsh</tt> to connect to it. In the CfA environment the configurations are kept
      in file:
      <code>/soft/SYBASE15.7/interfaces</code>
