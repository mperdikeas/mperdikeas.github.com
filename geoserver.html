      <li>configuring an external data directory in Geoserver</li>
      <p>
        By default, Geoserver uses a data directory under <tt>webapps/</tt>.
        This is, of course, ridiculous for persistence purposes, as on each undeploy all data are lost.
        To configure an external data directory able to survive undeployments, you need to edit <tt>WEB-INF/web.xml</tt> and set the value of the <i>context parameter</i> <tt>GEOSERVER_DATA_DIR</tt> to point to that directory. E.g.:
        <pre>
   &lt;context-param&gt;
      &lt;param-name&gt;GEOSERVER_DATA_DIR&lt;/param-name&gt;
       &lt;param-value&gt;/mnt/some-other-disk/geoserver-data&lt;/param-value&gt;
   &lt;/context-param&gt;</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        Purportedly setting and exporting the environment variable
        <tt>GEOSERVER_DATA_DIR</tt> on the shell from which Tomcat
        is launched has the same effect but my experience was to the
        contrary.

      <li>restore the <tt>root</tt> password in GeoServer</li>
      <p>
        After trying various suggestions on how to restore the
        <tt>root</tt> password in Geoserver, in the end, what did the
        trick was deleting the entire <tt>data/security</tt>
        directory at which point the default settings were
        restored.
      </p>
      <li>address logout and login problems</li>
      <p>
        In January 2025 while working with a GeoServer I had installed locally for
        my own development where I had simply copied over the
        <tt>data/</tt> directory of a production GeoServer (after having erased, first, the
        local <tt>data</tt> directory) I encountered problems in <i>logout</i> and, I belive,
        <i>login</i> which I addressed by editing file <tt>webapps/geoserver/data/global.xml</tt> and:
        <ul>
          <li>commenting out the element <tt>&lt;proxyBaseUrl&gt;</tt></li>
          <li>changing the value of the <tt>&lt;useHeadersProxyURL&gt;</tt> property
            from <tt>true</tt> to <tt>false</tt></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        As a matter of fact, I don't think the second part was necessary.
      </p>
      <li id='allow-root-login'>allow login with the <tt>root</tt> user in Geoserver</li>
      <p><a href="https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-10209?focusedCommentId=82882">provenance</a> (tried January 2025)</p>
      <p>
      Login via master password has been disabled by default back in 2018, see GEOS-8928: Disable master password Admin GUI login by default
        In order to enable root login, take the following steps:
        <ol>
          <li>Open “Passwords” in the Security sub-menu</li>
          <li>Open the master password provider (clicking on “default”)</li>
          <li>Select the “allow root user to login as admin” checkbox (unchecked by default)</li>
          <li>Log-out as admin, and try to log in back as “root”. You should succeed.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have lost the ability to get in as admin, you can enable the root login by going to the data directory,
        get into “security/masterpw/default”, open “config.xml” and switch loginEnabled to true. Then probably restart
        (not 100% sure it’s needed) and you should be able to login.

      <li id="geoserver-2.26.2-installation">installation of GeoServer <tt>2.26.2</tt> on Ubuntu 20.04 (January 2024)</li>
      <p>
        <span class='nb'>NB:</span> the below instructions assume that <tt>Java 11</tt> is already installed (I had the OpenJDK version).

        Contrary to representations on
        <a
          href="https://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/installation/war.html"
          >this page</a>

        which declare that
        <i>"GeoServer [2.26.x] requires a newer version of Tomcat (7.0.65 or
          later) that implements Servlet 3 [...]"</i>
        I nevertheless encountered
        <a href="https://gis.stackexchange.com/q/389555/158056"> this problem</a>
        which shows that GeoServer <tt>2.26.2</tt> is incompatible with Tomcat
        <tt>10.1.34</tt>. As advised in the 
        <a href="https://gis.stackexchange.com/a/389559/158056">
          currently accepted solution
        </a> I therefore installed Tomcat <tt>9.0.98</tt> using
        the procedure described below and found GeoServer to run fine with it.
        <ol>
          <li>download and explode the <tt>apache-tomcat-9.0.98.tar.gz</tt> tarball.</li>
          <li>enter into the <tt>/bin</tt> directory and create file
            <tt>setenv.sh</tt> as described in <tt>RUNNING.txt</tt> with the
            following contents:
            <pre>
CATALINA_HOME=/media/hddb/software/apache-tomcat/apache-tomcat-9.0.98/
CATALINA_BASE=/media/hddb/software/apache-tomcat/apache-tomcat-9.0.98/
JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/</pre>
          </li>
          <li>at this point Apache Tomcat can be started by running the
            <tt>bin/startup.sh</tt> script</li>
          <li>edit the <tt>conf/tomcat-users.xml</tt> file to activate
            the <i>admin</i> user for the <i>manager-gui</i> role
          </li>
          <li>I then downloaded the GeoServer web archive version
            from <a href="https://geoserver.org/download/">here</a>
            in the form of file <tt>geoserver-2.26.2-war.zip</tt>
          </li>
          <li>I unzipped said file and simply copyied the <tt>*.war</tt> that
              was inside under the <tt>webapps</tt> directory in <i>Tomcat</i>.
          </li>
          <li>pointing my browser at <tt>http://localhost:8080/geoserver</tt>
            I saw that <i>GeoSserver</i> was indeed availabe.
          </li>
        </ol>
