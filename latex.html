<li>how to install the latest geometry package in Ubuntu</li>
This is necessary to effectively use mixed A3 and A4 files in a document.
The below procedure can obviously be followed for other packages as well.
Sources: basically <a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/39165/52217">SO answer</a>
and, secondarily, <a href="http://soledadpenades.com/2011/03/29/updating-geometry-in-texlive-ubuntu/">this
blog post</a> (of which I didn't use the suggested location or the <tt>sudo texhash</tt> command).

<ol type="1">
    <li>Download the package from <a href="http://www.ctan.org/pkg/geometry">CTAN</a></li>
    <li>Copy the package in a temporary location, extract it, and compile the <tt>*.dtx</tt> file:
    <pre>tex geometry.dtx</pre>
    (the above step should produce <tt>geometry.sty</tt>)
    <li>Now the question becomes where to put the resultant <tt>*.sty</tt> file and how to
        let <b>Tex</b> find out about it. For that, I followed the approach of the first source
        referenced above</li>
    <pre>
cd /usr/local/share/texmf/
sudo mkdir -p tex/latex/footmisc
cd tex/latex/footmisc
sudo cp ~/path/to/the/sty/file/geometry.sty .
cd /usr/local/share/texmf/ ; sudo mktexlsr
    </pre>
    <li>At this point, the <tt>ls-R</tt> file should contain the geometry package:</li>
    <pre>cat ls-R</pre>

A slightly differrent approach would have been to copy the *.dtx (or even the entire package) in the
<tt>/usr/local/share/texmf</tt> directory tree and compile it there (and not in a temporary location
like the steps above do)
</ol>
