    <h1>How to open a shell through two successive SSH hops where SSH public key authentication is possible only on the first hop</h1>
    <a href='http://unix.stackexchange.com/q/320412/24044'>source 1</a><br/>
    <a href='http://superuser.com/q/606252/138891'>source 2</a>
    <p>
      Imagine you have to go through an intermediate machine
      (let's call it <i>$gateway</i> &mdash; sometimes the term "jump host" or "intermediate host" is also used) to reach a <i>$server</i>.<br/>
      Your workflow would be:
      <pre>
  ssh $gateway (supply password manually)
  ssh $server (supply password manually)
      </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are able to configure SSH public key authentication on the hop to the <i>$gateway</i> but <b>not</b> on the second hop to the <i>$server</i>, the best you would be able to do is:
      <pre>
  ssh $gateway (no password necessary)
  ssh $server (supply password manually)
      </pre>
      &hellip; or at most (with a single incantation):
      <pre>
    ssh -t $gateway ssh $server
      </pre>
      &hellip; where, however you'd still be prompted to manually
      enter a password.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further assume that you are unable to install <code>sshpass</code> or some
      other software on the <i>$gateway</i> machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately there is an incantation that will allow you to solve the connundrum
      that only requires <code>sshpass</code> to be install on your client machine
      (i.e. from where you make the first hop to <i>$server</i>).
      <pre>
sshpass -p $password ssh -oProxyCommand="ssh -W %h:%p $gateway" $server
      </pre>
      In the above incantation:
      <ul>
        <li>replace <i>$password</i>, <i>$gateway</i> and <i>$server</i> with the correct values</li>
        <li>leave <tt>%h:%p</tt> as it stands (those aren't placeholders)</li>
      </ul>
      <b>NB:</b>the incantation assumes that your username is the same
      in the client machine, <i>$gateway</i> and <i>$server</i>.
      Should this be not the case, then use <i>username@$gateway</i> as
      appropriate.
