    <h1>Get rid of the need to type-in passwords in SSH connections using SSH public key authentication</h1>
    <a id='source' href='http://www.linuxproblem.org/art_9.html'>source</a>
    <p>
      Assuming the following machines:
      <dl>
        <dt>A</dt><dd>your local node</dd>
        <dt>B</dt><dd>the node you wish to be able to hop to without having to enter a password every time</dd>
      </dl>
      &hellip; do the following:
      <h2>old-style manual way</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>on machine <b>A</b>:</li>
        If the file <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code> does not already exist do a:
        <pre>ssh-keygen -t rsa</pre>
        &hellip; and copy the long single line that this file contains into your clipboard
        <li>on machine <b>B</b></li>
        Copy the line you placed into the clipboard at the end of file: <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>
        (and make sure said file is readable).
        <b>NB 1:</b>make sure to add an end-of-line at the end otherwise the file will be mangled
        if you try to add an additional key using the more automated way described below.
      </ol>
      <h2>more automated way</h2>
      <p>
        Recently I did the following (<a href='http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/27052/24044'>source</a>) and it worked like a charm (provided the <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>
        file at the destination machine ends with an end-of-line character (<tt>0x0A</tt> in real operating systems).
        From the source machine:
        <pre>
ssh-copy-id -i  ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub youraccountname@destination.machine</pre>
      </p>
      <h3>update 2018 August</h3>
      <p>
        I used the following (also from the source machine):
        <pre>cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh youraccountname@destination.machine "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"</pre>
        &hellip; as advised <a href='https://askubuntu.com/a/262074/89663'>here</a>.
        The advantage of this method is that it does not require the <tt>ssh-copy-id</tt> program to be installed
        on the source machine.
      </p>
      <h2 id='caveats'>caveats</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>I have also encountered cases where it was necessary to do the following in machine <b>B</b>:
          <ul>
            <li><code>chmod 700 .ssh</code></li>
            <li><code>chmod 640 .ssh/authorized_keys</code></li>
          </ul>
          &hellip; this is described in the <a href='#source'>source</a>. Unless I applied
          those permissions <tt>ssh</tt> would still ask me for a password.
        </li>
        <li id='caveats-passwordless-ssh-disabled'>I have also encountered cases where public authentication (referred to
          by the sysadmin people as "passwordless SSH") was disabled for "security reasons" (whatever).
          Apparently this is configured in the <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt> file
          where, for instance in my system where I have SSH public key
          authentication enabled one sees:
          <pre>PubkeyAuthentication yes</pre>
          BTW, it is actually considered a best practice to <em>disable</em>
          password-based authentication and only allow public key-based
          authentication, i.e. the exact opposite of what those admins are doing!
