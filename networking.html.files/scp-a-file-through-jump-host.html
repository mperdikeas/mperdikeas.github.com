    <h1>how to <code>scp</code> a file through an intermediate host (a.k.a. jump host)</h1>
    
    There's various methods (with or without using an SSH tunnel). More recently I used
    and settled to <a href='#method-c'>method C</a>.
    <h2 id='method-a'>method A</h2>
    <a href='http://superuser.com/a/276549/138891'>source</a>
    <p>
      The situation is the following:<br/>
      <tt>A -- ssh --> B -- ssh --> C</tt>
      <br/>
      &hellip; where <tt>A</tt> is my client machine, <tt>B</tt> is
      the jump host and <tt>C</tt> is the final endpoint of the copy
      (either source or destination depending on the direction
      &mdash; the other endpoint being <tt>A</tt>)
    </p>
    <p>
      I 've used the following option from the source:
      <pre>
A$ scp -oProxyCommand="ssh -W %h:%p B" thefile C:destination</pre>
      &hellip; and as a matter of fact reversed the copy direction (e.g. I copied from system C to system A).
      I.e. the incantation I used was:
      <pre>
A$ scp -oProxyCommand = "ssh -W %h:%p username@B" username@C:/some/path/on/macine/C some/path/on/machine/A</pre>
    </p>
    <h2 id='method-b'>method B</h2>
    <a href='http://superuser.com/a/456450/138891'>source</a>
    <p>This is the method that I can understand more intuitively.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>open an SSH tunnel from A to B to C on local port 1234 (or some other unclaimed local port):
        <pre>
ssh -L 1234:C:22 username@B</pre>
      </li>
      <li>just bloody copy the file(s) through the local opening of the tunnel (1234) on the localhost:
        <pre>
scp -P 1234 -pr prj/ username@localhost:/some/path</pre>
      </li>
      <li>exit the tunnel you opened on the first step</li>
    </ol>
    Be sure to note in the <tt>scp</tt> invocation above that the uppercase <tt>-P</tt> flag specifies the
    port to use whereas the lowercase <tt>-p</tt> is for <b>p</b>reserving permission rights on files.

    <h2 id='method-c'>method C</h2>
    <p><a href='#method-b'>Method B</a> has the disadvantage that it requires that you use two shells, one for the tunnel and one
      for the actual <tt>scp</tt>. It also requires you to manually set up and tear down the tunnel. Finally you have to guess
      and reserve a local available port.
      This method does not suffer from these three problems.
    </p>
    <p>I used the method recommended in <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/a/16144454/274677'>this answer</a> without the <tt>-o 'Host remote2'</tt> part as advised in the <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/a/32216956/274677'>comments to this answer</a>.
      <pre>
scp -o 'ProxyCommand ssh username@B nc %h %p' someFile username@C:/some/path</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      I then improved upon that since modern versions of ssh have netcat-like abilities built-in and do not require
      <tt>nc</tt> on the intermediate host as advised in <a href='http://superuser.com/a/1034579/138891'>this answer</a>.
      So I did:
      <pre>
scp -o 'ProxyCommand ssh username@B -W %h:%p' someFile username@C:/some/path</pre>
      &hellip; which also worked &mdash; observe that there is now a colon (<tt>:</tt>) between <tt>%h</tt>
      and <tt>%p</tt> which wasn't there before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The final improvement was to use <tt>sshpass</tt> to avoid being prompted (I had setup SSH public key authentication
      between <tt>A</tt> and <tt>B</tt> but was unable to do so between <tt>B</tt> and <tt>C</tt>):
      <pre>
sshpass -f password scp -o 'ProxyCommand ssh username@B -W %h:%p' someFile username@C:/some/path</pre>
    </p>
    <h2>Update (October 2022)</h2>
    <p>
      <i>thanks to @moppman for reporting this &mdash; I have not had a chance to use this though</i>
      <p>
        A couple of years ago scp gained the ability to use jump hosts in a much more concise and intuitive manner. Using the <tt>-J</tt> flag, you can now do the following:

        <pre>scp -J username@B username@C:/some/path /some/path</pre>

        You can even add more jump hosts seperated by a comma.

        As scp's manual states, the <tt>-J</tt> flag is just a shortcut for ssh commands very
        similar to what I described in the other methods on this page.
