    <li>Resolving the <i>Can only update a mounted or mounting component</i> warning</li>
    <p>
      <a href='http://jaketrent.com/post/set-state-in-callbacks-in-react/'>source</a>
    </p>
    <p>
    It is clear that <code>this.setState</code> can only be called on a mounted or mounting component.
    A mildly confusing situation I encountered was a <code>this.setState</code> that was called from
    inside of a <code>componentDidMount</code> method and yet resulted in the afore-mentioned message.
    </p>
    <p>Obviously that was because the the <code>this.setState</code> was called from an asynchronous
      callback, as in the following code:
      <pre>
        componentDidMount: function() {
                $.getJSON(this.getURL(), function(data) {
                    this.setState({files: data});
                }.bind(this));
        }
      </pre>
      What fixed that (according to the <i>source</i>) was simply doing a:
      <pre>
        componentDidMount: function() {
                $.getJSON(this.getURL(), function(data) {
                    if (this.isMounted()) {
                        this.setState({files: data});
                    }
                }.bind(this));
        }
       </pre>
       The <i>source</i> also provides an alternative solution which I think is cleaner: abort the
       asynchronous request in the <code>componentWillUnmount</code> method (assuming of course that
       the network library you are using provides an abort API).
    <li>ReactJS state versus properties</li>
    <p>
    There are many resources on the subject that one can google about. For the benefit
    of my future self I've put together a small example in my <a href='https://github.com/mperdikeas/playground/tree/master/javascript/react/my-projects/03-fliping-tiles'>playground github repo</a> that shows how to properly 
    use <i>state</i>. Bottom line is that <i>state</i> lives in the parent components and flows
    down into the child components as <i>properties</i>. Also, <i>state</i> is not set upon
    component initialization. The proper way to set <i>state</i> is with the <code>setState</code> method
    so that React can automatically call <code>render</code> on the component whose state was altered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover the following guidelines are useful:
      <ul>
        <li>a component should only change its <b>own</b> state but never its own <i>props</i> </li>
        <li>instead, a component <b>sets</b> the <i>props</i> of its children</li>
        <li>it is an antipattern to use <i>props</i> to generate the state in <code>getInitialState</code>
          unless it is done only for seeding (in which case prefix the properties name with <tt>initial</tt>
          to make the intention clear).
          <br/>E.g.:
          <dl>
            <dt>props:</dt><dd>initialCount</dd>
            <dt>state:</dt><dd>count</dd>
          </dl>
         </ul>
         See <a href='https://facebook.github.io/react/tips/props-in-getInitialState-as-anti-pattern.html'>here</a> for
         more on the subject.

    <li>how to solve CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues with webpack</li>
<p>
    It is often the case when doing development in Webpack that you
    have your, e.g. React JXS code running in the webpack development server
    (the one you typically launch with <code>npm run dev</code>) and you need
    that front-end code to access via Ajax some back-end services, e.g. some
    JAX-RS module deployed in a Tomcat container.
</p>
<p>
  In those cases, one runs into <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS'>CORS</a> issues.
  To solve the problem you have to enable CORS on the <b>backend</b> module as described
  in <a href='jax-rs.html#jersey-1.9-cors'>this note</a>.
  </p>
  I have created an <a href="https://github.com/mperdikeas/archetypes/tree/master/jax-rs/004-jaxrs-example-with-CORS-and-a-frontend-webpack-app-in-dev-server">archetype project</a> to exemplify the full chain, from a React front-end application running
  in webpack development server to a back-end JAX-RS module deployed in a Tomcat container.
