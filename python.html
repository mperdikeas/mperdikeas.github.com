<li>static code analyzers in Python</li>
flake8 and pylint
</p>Typical sequence of commands to install them:
<pre>
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install flake8
sudo pip install pylint
</pre>
<li>templating library in Python</li>
<pre>
import jinja2
</pre>
It is used in the latest incarnation of Django and is comparable to
<i>StringTemplate</i> albeit more powerful as it allows one to 
write pythonic code for the expansion of the template.
<li>library for multiprocessing in Python</li>
<pre>
import multiprocessing
</pre>
The multiprocessing library of Python has a very lightweight fork
under Linux since fork in Linux systems is <i>copy on write</i>.
One can easily fork 5,000 processes in a second.
<li>how to install C modules in python</li>
It is necessary to first have installed the <b>python-dev</b>
package.<p>So, for instance the following were the steps I undertook
to install the Levenshtein python module:
<pre>
sudo apt-get install python-dev
wget http://pylevenshtein.googlecode.com/files/python-Levenshtein-0.10.1.tar.bz2
tar xvfj python-Levenshtein-0.10.1.tar.bz2
cd python-Levenshtein-0.10.1
sudo python setup.py install
</pre>

<li>great python library: <b>collections</b></li>
It provides, among others, the <b>defaultdict</b>:
<pre>
from collections import defaultdict
a = defaultdict(int) # int is a lambda that's used to init values (to 0 in this case as that's the default constructor)
a['foo']+=3
</pre>
<li>python unicode function</li>
how to declare a unicode literal:
<pre>
a = u'ΤΙΜΟΛ
</pre>
<li>unicode function</li>
The unicode function in Python takes as input a string encoded
in a certain code-page and returns the unicode representation
of that string. To perform its task it must be given the code page
as an argument. E.g. for string <i>a</i> being a Greek-encoded 
text, to convert it to unicode:
<pre>
b = unicode(a, 'iso8859-7')
</pre>
In both python 2.7 and python 2.5, the function <i>unicode</i>
will throw an exception (TypeError: decoding Unicode is not supported)
if handed a string that's already Unicode.
<li>unicode function</li>
In Jython, the <i>unicode</i> function won't complain as it 
expects all Strings handed to it to be unicode to begin with (since
we're in Java). So, the fact that the
following code in Jython does not complain
<u>does not</u>, repeat <u>does not</u> prove that the
input string is indeed Greek:
<pre>
b = unicode(a, 'iso8859-7')
</pre>
<li><b>str</b> function in Python</li>
The <b>str</b> function in Python stringifies its arguments
which can be of any type. However, it cannot handle Strings that
contain bytes greater than 128 since these are necessarily
locale-specific. This doesn't mean that it can't handle Unicode
strings in general as some Unicode strings can have all their
bytes below or equal to 128. So the following succeed:
<pre>
str('a')
str(u'a')
</pre>
but the following fails:
<pre>
str(u'α')
</pre>
.. however, the following also, mysteriously succeeds:
<pre>
str('άλφα')
</pre>
This is because the implementation of <b>str</b>
simply immediately returns its argument if that is of type <i>str</i> 
(this can be verified with 'help(str)').
Note that in
Python, type <i>str</i> is distinct from <i>unicode</i> and there is no
inheritance relationship as the following commands will show:
<pre>
type (u'a')
type ('a')
isinstance(u'a', str)
isinstance(u'a', unicode)
</pre>
</ol>
