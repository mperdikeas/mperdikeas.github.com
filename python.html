<li>python unicode function</li>
how to declare a unicode literal:
<pre>
a = u'ΤΙΜΟΛ
</pre>
<li>unicode function</li>
The unicode function in Python takes as input a string encoded
in a certain code-page and returns the unicode representation
of that string. To perform its task it must be given the code page
as an argument. E.g. for string <i>a</i> being a Greek-encoded 
text, to convert it to unicode:
<pre>
b = unicode(a, 'iso8859-7')
</pre>
In both python 2.7 and python 2.5, the function <i>unicode</i>
will throw an exception (TypeError: decoding Unicode is not supported)
if handed a string that's already Unicode.
<li>unicode function</li>
In Jython, the <i>unicode</i> function won't complain as it 
expects all Strings handed to it to be unicode to begin with (since
we're in Java). So, the fact that the
following code in Jython does not complain
<u>does not</u>, repeat <u>does not</u> prove that the
input string is indeed Greek:
<pre>
b = unicode(a, 'iso8859-7')
</pre>
<li><b>str</b> function in Python</li>
The <b>str</b> function in Python stringifies its arguments
which can be of any type. However, it cannot handle Strings that
contain bytes greater than 128 since these are necessarily
locale-specific. This doesn't mean that it can't handle Unicode
strings in general as some Unicode strings can have all their
bytes below or equal to 128. So the following succeed:
<pre>
str('a')
str(u'a')
</pre>
but the following fails:
<pre>
str(u'α')
</pre>
.. however, the following succeeds:
<pre>
str('άλφα')
</pre>
</ol>
