      <li>how to fix a broken Python installation</li>
      <a id='fix-python'>
      <p>
        In February 2022 I used <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/a/67621734/274677'>these instructions</a> to repair a
        hopelessly broken Python on an Ubuntu 16.04 machine that was
        prevent a <a href='./admin.html#broken-python-prevents-upgrade'>release upgrade</a>. Python was broken because apparently I had made the mistake
        of using <pre>sudo pip install</pre> at some point, which one is
        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/q/29310688/274677'>strongly advised</a> never to use.

      <li>how to install when-changed on Ubuntu 18.04</li>
      In August 2021 I used the following to install <tt>when-changed</tt> on an Ubuntu 18.04 machine
      with Python3 already installed:
      <pre>pip install when-changed</pre>
      <li>how to list all Python modules in a system (built-in and from custom PYTHONPATH)</li>
      <p>
        Launch Python and in the REPL type <tt>help('modules')</tt>. This will list all modules
        whether built-in or modules stored in a custom <tt>PYTHONPATH</tt>. By using <tt>help('somemodule')</tt>
        you can obtain more information including the path to the <tt>*.py</tt> file for each module. From the file
        information where you can easily see if the module is built-in
        or rather present in some custom <tt>PYTHONPATH</tt>.
