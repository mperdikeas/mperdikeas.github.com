      <li>October 2023 &mdash; how I upgraded the <tt>nodejs</tt> version to <tt>Node 20x</tt> and then went back to where I started (twice)</li>
      <p>
        Initially, I tried to follow the instructions given <a href='https://askubuntu.com/a/1401499'>here</a>:
        <pre>
This set of instructions will install whatever version is the latest LTS version.
When a new version is released, you may have to run these instructions again to
 pull the new install script for the new version.

# As a user with sudo
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# As root
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | bash -
apt-get install -y nodejs
        </pre>    
      </p>
      <p>
        However, upon executing the script I encountered the following warning:
        <img src='./npm-and-node.html.files/node-install-script-deprecation-warning.png' />
      </p>

      <p>
        <a id='killed-the-script-and-followed-the-instructions'>
        As a result of the above warning, I killed the script and followed (as advised)
        the instructions given
        <a href='https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#debian-and-ubuntu-based-distributions'>here</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        First off, I checked that the latest suport Node version for my Ubuntu system (which is <tt>20.04</tt>)
        was Node <tt>20x</tt>:
        <img src='npm-and-node.html.files/node-supported-versions-per-Ubuntu-system.png'/>
      </p>
      <p>
        I then followed the instructions given below to first download and import the Nodesource GPG key:
        <pre>
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/gpgkey/nodesource-repo.gpg.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/nodesource.gpg
        </pre>
        &hellip; then to create the deb repository (where I used <tt>NODE_MAJOR=20</tt>):
        <pre>
NODE_MAJOR=20
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/nodesource.gpg] https://deb.nodesource.com/node_$NODE_MAJOR.x nodistro main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nodesource.list
        </pre>
        &hellip; and finally I run update and install as instructed:
        <pre>
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nodejs -y
        </pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, after all this effort I discovered that the new node version breaks the build of a very crucial application (IACS)
        so I had to downgrade back to Node 14 (which is where I started off) by doing the following:

      <ol>
        <li>purge Node:
<pre>sudo apt purge nodejs</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          Installing an older version of Node by following the instructions given <a href='#2022-May-Node_upgrade'>here</a>.
        </li>
      </ol>
      </p>      
      <p>
        After that (during which process I ignored all deprecation warnings which incidentally hadn't appeared the last
        time I run this script), I was back where I started:
        <pre>
$ node --version
v14.21.3
mperdikeas@mp-ThinkStation-P320:~/repos/prj/cognitera-iacs/iacs-ui#
$ npm --version
6.14.18
</pre>
&hellip; and my application build worked as before. I also verified that this
is the correct
<a href='https://stackoverflow.com/a/51243675/274677'>correspondance between Node and NPM versions</a>.
See also <a href='https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases'>here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        That would have been the end of the travail for a neurotypical person, but not for me. I subsequently
        carried away and decided to see whether I can upgrade to the latest version of <tt>npm</tt> by
        using:
        <pre>sudo npm install -g npm@latest</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately the above failed badly as when I tried to run <tt>npm</tt> I got:
        <pre>ERROR: npm v10.2.0 is known not to run on Node.js v14.21.3. ...</pre>
        I.e. I had managed to upgrade to <tt>npm</tt> version <tt>10</tt> but that version was incompatible
        with the Node version <tt>14</tt> I am using. Furthermore, I was unable to use the following
        to downgrade back to the compatible <tt>npm</tt> version for my version of <tt>Node</tt>:
        <pre>$ npm install  -g npm@6.14.18</pre>
        In fact the error message was exactly the same, I wasn't
        even able to run <tt class='console'>npm --version</tt>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, I was left with no other option available than to repeat the entire ordeal once again, i.e.
        purge <tt>Node</tt> (this also purges <tt>npm</tt> as part of the process) and re-install <tt>Node</tt>
        version <tt>14</tt> (which also installs <tt>npm</tt> version <tt>6</tt> as part of the process). This
        went smoothly (like the first time) and I was now back to where I started two hours later but with one
        important realization: That <tt>Node</tt> and <tt>npm</tt> are inextricably tied together and that I
        should never bother with installing <tt>npm</tt> independently. Just accept the version that comes
        bundled with <tt>Node</tt>.
      </p>
        However, there's more to it. At (what I thought was) the end of this ordeal I had the following:
      <pre>
        $ node -v
        v14.21.3
        $ npm -v
        6.14.18 </pre>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, every time I tried to run <tt>npm</tt> I got:
        <pre>
$ npm install -g npm@6.14.17

        </pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact the only <tt>npm</tt> command I was able to run was <tt clas=s'console'>npm -v</tt>.
        Googling revealed that this case existed but there was only
        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/q/77098688/274677'a single low-visibility
           question on SO</a>. Incidentally, the question was only a month old pointing to some
        recent breakage.
      </p>
      <p>
        I frantically tried the same cycle a couple of times more (i.e. purging <tt>Node</tt> and then installing
        version 14) but I kept getting the same results.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, at the point where I was beginning to despair, I decided to follow 
        <a href='https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#debian-and-ubuntu-based-distributions'>these instructions</a>
        which I had also tried <a href='killed-the-script-and-followed-the-instructions'>near the beginning of this ordeal</a>
        with the difference this time of setting the <tt>NODE_MAJOR</tt> environmental variable to something less than 20.
        So I tried first with <tt>18</tt> but the resultant <tt>Node/npm</tt> configuration was breaking the build of my
        IACS application (mentioned above). I then tried with <tt>16</tt> and everything is working fine.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, at the end of this ordeal I did manage to upgrade the <tt>Node</tt>/<tt>npm</tt> versions to the following:
        <pre>
$ node --version
v16.20.2
$ npm --version
8.19.4
        </pre>
      </p>
      <li><a id='2022-May-Node_upgrade'>how I upgraded the <tt>nodejs</tt> version to the latest LTS (I think) version</li>
      <p>
        (source: <a href='https://askubuntu.com/a/1291854'>https://askubuntu.com/a/1291854</a>)
        I executed the following commands (<i>May 2022</i>):
<pre>sudo apt update
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs
node -v</pre>
      </p>
      <p>After running the last command I saw:
<pre>$ node -v
v14.19.2
</pre>
      </p>
      <p><i>However</i>, due to what I am almost confident are broken dependencies issues among my packages, the installation
        of <tt>node</tt> messed up my <tt>npm</tt> and I was unable to re-install it with conventional means. As such, I
        had to download the <tt>node</tt> tarball from <a href='https://nodejs.org/download/release/v14.6.0/'>here</a>,
        explode the tarball
        in a directory and set in my <tt>PATH</tt> the path to <tt>node-v14.16.0-linux-x64/bin</tt> (wherein the <tt>npm</tt>
        executable is to be found). This was mighty iffy and unsettling.

        with
        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/a/45546082/274677'>that SO answer</a>,
one can arrive at the following solution:

export npm_config_cache=$(shell mktemp -d)

install:
    @printf "using throw-away cache at: [$$npm_config_cache]\n"
    npm install

clean:
    rm -fr node_modules/
    rm -f es5/*.js
    rm -f es5/*.map
    npm cache -f clean # this is not really necessary as we're using a throw-away cache </pre>

      On 2016-02-20 the following procedure (<a href="http://www.thelacunablog.com/install-livereload-ubuntu.html">source</a>) worked for me:
      <ol type="1">
        <li>sudo apt-get install ruby-dev</li>

        <li>sudo gem install guard -V</li>
        <li>sudo gem install guard-livereload -V</li>
      </ol>
      <br/>
      I think actually step 4 was the only necessary step.
      <br/>
      I then created the symlinks mentioned in
      <a href="#how-to-install-guard-livereload">this post below</a>.
      <li id='how-to-install-guard-livereload'>How to install <b>guard-livereload</b></li>
      What worked for me (in 2015-10) was to follow the instructions from:
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <a href="https://github.com/guard/guard-livereload">the github repo for <b>guard-livereload</b></a>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I've also created a script to run <b>guard</b> (in <code>~/playground/repo-wide-scripts</code>).
      <br/>
      I the same location I've also created:
      <ul>
        <li>A sample <code>Guardfile</code></li>
        <li>The <code>Gemfile</code> to be used</li>
      </ul>
      Basically what needs now be done (in a new project, new machine) is:
      <ol>
        <li><code>sudo gem install guard-livereload</code></li>
        <li><code>sudo apt-get install bundler</code></li>
        <li><code>ln -s ~/playground/repo-wide-scripts/Gemfile</code></li>
        <li><code>ln -s ~/playground/repo-wide-scripts/Guardfile</code></li>
        <li><code>ln -s ~/playground/repo-wide-scripts/run-guard</code></li>
      </ol>
      <br/>
      An example of this properly setup and working well is found in my <a href="https://github.com/mperdikeas/playground/tree/master/javascript-canvas/004-bouncing-ball-physics">bouncing ball project</a> (file <code>run-guard</code> which ultimately

      I have used the approach to install node packages via the <code>npm</code> tool in the home folder as described 
      <a href='http://www.sitepoint.com/beginners-guide-node-package-manager/'>here</a>.
      However with this approach, one (at least in Ubuntu 14.04) cannot use the <code>nodejs</code> executable
      but has to use the <code>node</code> one that is available with the <code>nvm</code> tool.
      This is described <a href='https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-an-ubuntu-14-04-server'>here</a> in the section "How to Install Using NVM".
      <strong>NB:</strong>I actually had to use <code>sudo curl .. | sh</code> to install it.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Then don't forget upon installing a package, e.g. <code>npm prompt</code> to also do <code>nvm link prompt</code>
      (as described in the link above). An example is given in:
