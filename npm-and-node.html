      <li>April 2024 &mdash; how I removed <tt>Node</tt> and then installed <tt>nvm</tt> and (after that) <tt>Node</tt> again</li>
      <p>
      I wanted to develop a backend application (rest API) using NestJS but read that it requires
      Node version &ge;16. Given previous complications when trying to upgrade the version of Node, I decided
      to use <tt>nvm</tt> this time as that would allow me to have multiple versions of <tt>Node</tt> (and associated
        versions of <tt>npm</tt>) on my system.
      </p>
      <p>
        I followed the instructions from ChatGPT which read as follows:<br/>
        <a href='npm-and-node.html.nvm-installation-guide-chatGPT.png'>
          <img width="400" src='npm-and-node.html.nvm-installation-guide-chatGPT.png'>
        </a>
        <br/>
        I had to correct the numbering because ChatGPT numbered all sections as <i>1</i> and obstinately
        refused to number them correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
        I actually skipped steps <i>1</i> and <i>2</i> (no ill effects as I already had <tt>curl</tt> and
        <tt>wget</tt> installed in their latest versions). More importantly, before attempting to install
        <tt>nvm</tt> I did the following:
        <ol type='i'>
          <li>I established and recorded somewhere that the currently available version of
            <tt>Node</tt> (with which all existing
            applications work fine) was <tt>v14.21.3</tt> which is also, BTW, the latest version available
            on the official Ubuntu 22.04 repos.</li>
          <li>removed the existing <tt>Node</tt> installation:
        <pre>sudo apt purge nodejs</pre></li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, at first I followed some other instructions so I attempted to install <tt>nvm</tt> using a
        different script:
        <pre>curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/master/install.sh | bash</pre>
        &hellip; but when installation of the above script failed with:
        <pre>You have $NVM_DIR set to "~/.nvm", but that directory does not exist.
Check your profile files and environment.</pre>
        &hellip; I used the ChatGPT instructions even though &mdash;unbeknowest to me at
        that point&mdash; I encountered the exact same problem with the ChatGPT instructions
        too (and eventually solved it).
      </p>
      <p>
        Before executing step <i>3</i> in the ChatGPT instructions I established that the latest <tt>nvm</tt>
        version at that time was actually <tt>0.39.2</tt> so I executed step <i>3</i> as follows:
        <pre>curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.2/install.sh | bash</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        However the above failed with the same message as before:
        <pre>You have $NVM_DIR set to "~/.nvm", but that directory does not exist.
Check your profile files and environment.</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        Curiously, even when I manually created the <tt>~/.nvm</tt> directory prior to running
        the above script, it failed again, with the <b>exact</b> same message even though
        such a directory (empty) now clearly existed. Let it also be recorded that I, very consciously,
        resisted the tempation to install <tt>nvm</tt> under <i>sudo</i> privilleges as <tt>nvm</tt>
        is meant to be run be ordinary users.
      </p>
      <p>
        I then explored what is the value of the <tt>NVM_DIR</tt> variable. It gave the following:
        <pre>$ echo $NVM_DIR
~/.nvm</pre>
        This variable is apparently declared in <tt>~/.bashrc</tt> and has been there for quite some
        time (most likely as the result of a previous <tt>nvm</tt> installation). I speculated then that
        perhaps some script is run as a user other than <i>mperdikeas</i> so I explicitly exported
        this variable on the shell substituting <i>~</i> for <i>mperdikeas</i>:
        <pre>export NVM_DIR=/home/mperdikeas/.nvm</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        After the above, I re-run the installation script and this time it completed successfuly
        so that was the root of the problem:
        <a href='npm-and-node.html.nvm-successful-installation.png'>
          <img width="50%" src='npm-and-node.html.nvm-successful-installation.png'/>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        After this last step, there were some conflicting / confusing instructions I encountered only.
        First of all, some said that the installation script modifies file <tt>~/.profile</tt>. However,
        I noticed no such modification. Then some said that I have to source <i>~/.bashrc</i> before
        I can use <tt>nvm</tt>. I tried that but I had a problem in my <tt>~/.bashrc</tt> script
        and it failed. Eventually I sourced the <tt>~/.nvm/nvm.sh</tt> file and then I was indeed
        able to run <tt>nvm</tt>. However, I couldn't afford to be doing that on every shell I opened.
        Also, I noted at that time that the <tt>nvm</tt> installation script had indeed modified
        the <tt>~/.bashrc</tt> file. Finally I noticed that, even after the script modifications
        to <tt>~/.bashrc</tt>, when opening other shells I would get:
        <pre>$ nvm --version

Command 'nvm' not found, but there are 13 similar ones.</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end after some googling I had the following three lines added
        in my <tt>~/.bashrc</tt> file (click the image link for the text)
        <a href='npm-and-node.html.bashrc-modifications.png.html'>
          <img src='npm-and-node.html.bashrc-modifications.png'/>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I do believe (with 95% certainty) that the last line (line no 282) was
        added automatically by the script and that the first two lines (lines no 278-9)
        were manually added by me. After that, I was able to remove the following two older lines
        which I had added in some past experimantation with <tt>nvm</tt>:<br/>
        <img src='npm-and-node.html.bashrc-old-lines-removal.png'/>
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, I had <tt>nvm</tt> available in all new shells. So this concludes the
        <tt>nvm</tt> installation part proper.
      </p>
      <p>Following that I installed the below two versions of node:
        <ol type='i'>
          <li><pre>nvm install --lts</pre> and &hellip;</li>
          <li><pre>nvm use lts/fermium</pre></li>
        </ol>
        The latter one corresponding to the <tt>v14</tt> version of <tt>Node</tt> that I
        had recorded previously as the only being used by current applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        I then grew tired of having to type:
        <pre>nvm use lts/fermium</pre>
        every time I wanted to use the existing applications and so did a:
        <pre>nvm alias default lts/fermium</pre> in some random shell.
        Following that in every new shell I opened I had <tt>v14.21.3</tt>
        as the default <tt>Node</tt> version while also being able to
        do <pre>nvm use lts/iron</pre> when wanting to play with <tt>NestJS</tt>.
      </p>
      <p>And there the matter rests having been successfully concluded.</p>
      <li>October 2023 &mdash; how I upgraded the <tt>nodejs</tt> version to <tt>Node 20x</tt> and then went back to where I started (twice)</li>
      <p>
        Initially, I tried to follow the instructions given <a href='https://askubuntu.com/a/1401499'>here</a>:
        <pre>
This set of instructions will install whatever version is the latest LTS version.
When a new version is released, you may have to run these instructions again to
 pull the new install script for the new version.

# As a user with sudo
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# As root
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | bash -
apt-get install -y nodejs
        </pre>    
      </p>
      <p>
        However, upon executing the script I encountered the following warning:
        <img src='./npm-and-node.html.files/node-install-script-deprecation-warning.png' />
      </p>

      <p>
        <a id='killed-the-script-and-followed-the-instructions'>
        As a result of the above warning, I killed the script and followed (as advised)
        the instructions given
        <a href='https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#debian-and-ubuntu-based-distributions'>here</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        First off, I checked that the latest suport Node version for my Ubuntu system (which is <tt>20.04</tt>)
        was Node <tt>20x</tt>:
        <img src='npm-and-node.html.files/node-supported-versions-per-Ubuntu-system.png'/>
      </p>
      <p>
        I then followed the instructions given below to first download and import the Nodesource GPG key:
        <pre>
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/gpgkey/nodesource-repo.gpg.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/nodesource.gpg
        </pre>
        &hellip; then to create the deb repository (where I used <tt>NODE_MAJOR=20</tt>):
        <pre>
NODE_MAJOR=20
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/nodesource.gpg] https://deb.nodesource.com/node_$NODE_MAJOR.x nodistro main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nodesource.list
        </pre>
        &hellip; and finally I run update and install as instructed:
        <pre>
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nodejs -y
        </pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, after all this effort I discovered that the new node version breaks the build of a very crucial application (IACS)
        so I had to downgrade back to Node 14 (which is where I started off) by doing the following:

      <ol>
        <li>purge Node:
<pre>sudo apt purge nodejs</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          Installing an older version of Node by following the instructions given <a href='#2022-May-Node_upgrade'>here</a>.
        </li>
      </ol>
      </p>      
      <p>
        After that (during which process I ignored all deprecation warnings which incidentally hadn't appeared the last
        time I run this script), I was back where I started:
        <pre>
$ node --version
v14.21.3
mperdikeas@mp-ThinkStation-P320:~/repos/prj/cognitera-iacs/iacs-ui#
$ npm --version
6.14.18
</pre>
&hellip; and my application build worked as before. I also verified that this
is the correct
<a href='https://stackoverflow.com/a/51243675/274677'>correspondance between Node and NPM versions</a>.
See also <a href='https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases'>here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        That would have been the end of the travail for a neurotypical person, but not for me. I subsequently
        carried away and decided to see whether I can upgrade to the latest version of <tt>npm</tt> by
        using:
        <pre>sudo npm install -g npm@latest</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately the above failed badly as when I tried to run <tt>npm</tt> I got:
        <pre>ERROR: npm v10.2.0 is known not to run on Node.js v14.21.3. ...</pre>
        I.e. I had managed to upgrade to <tt>npm</tt> version <tt>10</tt> but that version was incompatible
        with the Node version <tt>14</tt> I am using. Furthermore, I was unable to use the following
        to downgrade back to the compatible <tt>npm</tt> version for my version of <tt>Node</tt>:
        <pre>$ npm install  -g npm@6.14.18</pre>
        In fact the error message was exactly the same, I wasn't
        even able to run <tt class='console'>npm --version</tt>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, I was left with no other option available than to repeat the entire ordeal once again, i.e.
        purge <tt>Node</tt> (this also purges <tt>npm</tt> as part of the process) and re-install <tt>Node</tt>
        version <tt>14</tt> (which also installs <tt>npm</tt> version <tt>6</tt> as part of the process). This
        went smoothly (like the first time) and I was now back to where I started two hours later but with one
        important realization: That <tt>Node</tt> and <tt>npm</tt> are inextricably tied together and that I
        should never bother with installing <tt>npm</tt> independently. Just accept the version that comes
        bundled with <tt>Node</tt>.
      </p>
        However, there's more to it. At (what I thought was) the end of this ordeal I had the following:
      <pre>
        $ node -v
        v14.21.3
        $ npm -v
        6.14.18 </pre>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, every time I tried to run <tt>npm</tt> I got:
        <pre>
$ npm install -g npm@6.14.17

        </pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact the only <tt>npm</tt> command I was able to run was <tt clas=s'console'>npm -v</tt>.
        Googling revealed that this case existed but there was only
        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/q/77098688/274677'>a single low-visibility
           question on SO</a>. Incidentally, the question was only a month old pointing to some
        recent breakage.
      </p>
      <p>
        I frantically tried the same cycle a couple of times more (i.e. purging <tt>Node</tt> and then installing
        version 14) but I kept getting the same results.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, at the point where I was beginning to despair, I decided to follow 
        <a href='https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#debian-and-ubuntu-based-distributions'>these instructions</a>
        which I had also tried <a href='killed-the-script-and-followed-the-instructions'>near the beginning of this ordeal</a>
        with the difference this time of setting the <tt>NODE_MAJOR</tt> environmental variable to something less than 20.
        So I tried first with <tt>18</tt> but the resultant <tt>Node/npm</tt> configuration was breaking the build of my
        IACS application (mentioned above). I then tried with <tt>16</tt> and everything is working fine.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, at the end of this ordeal I did manage to upgrade the <tt>Node</tt>/<tt>npm</tt> versions to the following:
        <pre>
$ node --version
v16.20.2
$ npm --version
8.19.4
        </pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>update a couple of days later (at 2023-10-17)</b><br/>
        Alas, this was not meant to be. A couple of days later I tried to run
        the <tt>create-react-app</tt> application and came across this dreaded
        message (which I have often seen before):
        <pre>
$ npx create-react-app cognitera-app-1 --template typescript
npm ERR! must provide string spec

npm ERR! A complete log of this run can be found in:
npm ERR!     /home/mperdikeas/.npm/_logs/2023-10-17T11_42_06_557Z-debug-0.log </pre>
      </p>
      <p>&hellip; not only that but at further investigation I realized, to my horror, that
        I could not even run <tt>npm install</tt> any more as it failed with the exact
        same message. I came to the awful realization that my previous upgrade (to version
        16 of <tt>node</tt> and version 8 of <tt>npm</tt>) was broken. Moreover, reading my
        previous notes in this travail, I further realized in horror that I wouldn't even be able
        to downgrade to <tt>node</tt> version 14 as previous attempts had fail. What's more
        this realization came only after I had opened the gates of Hell with:
        <pre class='console'>sudo apt purge node</pre>. I now faced the spectre of a totally broken system
        with no possibility to ever install <tt>node</tt> or <tt>npm</tt>.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, despite all odds, and despite my previously paintstakingly elaborate notes
        to the contrary,
        this time the installation of <tt>node</tt> 14 miraculously succeeded and was
        entirely uneventful:
        <pre>
$curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo bash -
 ...
$sudo apt install -y nodejs
 ...
$ node -v
v14.21.3
$ npm -v
6.14.18
        </pre>

        &hellip; Moreover, I confirmed that I was now able to execute
        both <tt class='console'>npm install</tt>
        and <tt class='console'>npx create-react-app</tt>
      </p>
      <p>
        So, eventually, I manage to safely return back to where I had started (for the third time).
        I have no explanation as to why this time I was able to install <tt>Node</tt> version 14
        even though in the previous attempts I failed miserably. Perhaps the intermediate
        installation of <tt>Node</tt> version 16 changed something in the system?
      </p>
      <p>
        This is is all very unsettling.
        I think the morale of the story is to be extremely hessitant in updating the <tt>node</tt>
        or <tt>npm</tt> versions of the system. I have also realized that <tt>node</tt>, <tt>npm</tt>
        (and <tt>npx</tt> too) are inextricably tied together and are installed together as
        part of the <tt>Node</tt> installation. The part about <tt>npx</tt> was confirmed
        independently by ChatGPT.
      </p>
      <li><a id='2022-May-Node_upgrade'>how I upgraded the <tt>nodejs</tt> version to the latest LTS (I think) version</li>
      <p>
        (source: <a href='https://askubuntu.com/a/1291854'>https://askubuntu.com/a/1291854</a>)
        I executed the following commands (<i>May 2022</i>):
<pre>sudo apt update
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs
node -v</pre>
      </p>
      <p>After running the last command I saw:
<pre>$ node -v
v14.19.2
</pre>
      </p>
      <p><i>However</i>, due to what I am almost confident are broken dependencies issues among my packages, the installation
        of <tt>node</tt> messed up my <tt>npm</tt> and I was unable to re-install it with conventional means. As such, I
        had to download the <tt>node</tt> tarball from <a href='https://nodejs.org/download/release/v14.6.0/'>here</a>,
        explode the tarball
        in a directory and set in my <tt>PATH</tt> the path to <tt>node-v14.16.0-linux-x64/bin</tt> (wherein the <tt>npm</tt>
        executable is to be found). This was mighty iffy and unsettling.

      <p>
        By combining <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/a/36155362/274677'>this SO answer</a>
        with
        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/a/45546082/274677'>that SO answer</a>,
one can arrive at the following solution:
        <pre>
export npm_config_cache=$(shell mktemp -d)

install:
    @printf "using throw-away cache at: [$$npm_config_cache]\n"
    npm install
    @du -h $$npm_config_cache | printf "size of temp cache is: $$(du -h . | tail -1 | cut -f1)\n"
    @rm -fr $$npm_config_cache
    @printf "temporary cache at: $$npm_config_cache is now deleted.\n"

clean:
    rm -fr node_modules/
    rm -f es5/*.js
    rm -f es5/*.map
    npm cache -f clean # this is not really necessary as we're using a throw-away cache </pre>

      The following has worked for me in Ubuntu 14.04 and 12.04:

sudo npm install npm@3 -g
$ npm -version

      The following process worked for me on Ubuntu 14.04 and 12.04 and allowed me to install Node.js v4.3.2:
      <br/>
      In a sudo shell:
      <pre>
apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv 68576280
apt-add-repository 'deb https://deb.nodesource.com/node_4.x precise main'
apt-get update
apt-get install nodejs

      <b>NB:</b>I also have <tt>node</tt> symlinked via "alternatives" to <tt>nodejs</tt>:

      <li id='how-to-install-guard-livereload'>How to install <b>guard-livereload</b></li>
      On 2016-02-20 the following procedure (<a href="http://www.thelacunablog.com/install-livereload-ubuntu.html">source</a>) worked for me:
      <ol type="1">
        <li>sudo apt-get install ruby-dev</li>
        <li>sudo gem install rdoc -V</li>
        <li>sudo gem install guard -V</li>
        <li>sudo gem install guard-livereload -V</li>
      </ol>
      <br/>
      I think actually step 4 was the only necessary step.
      <br/>
      I then created the symlinks mentioned in
      <a href="#how-to-install-guard-livereload">this post below</a>.
      <li id='how-to-install-guard-livereload'>How to install <b>guard-livereload</b></li>
      What worked for me (in 2015-10) was to follow the instructions from:
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <a href="https://github.com/guard/guard-livereload">the github repo for <b>guard-livereload</b></a>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I've also created a script to run <b>guard</b> (in <code>~/playground/repo-wide-scripts</code>).
      <br/>
      I the same location I've also created:
      <ul>
        <li>A sample <code>Guardfile</code></li>
        <li>The <code>Gemfile</code> to be used</li>
      </ul>
      Basically what needs now be done (in a new project, new machine) is:
      <ol>
        <li><code>sudo gem install guard-livereload</code></li>
        <li><code>sudo apt-get install bundler</code></li>
        <li><code>ln -s ~/playground/repo-wide-scripts/Gemfile</code></li>
        <li><code>ln -s ~/playground/repo-wide-scripts/Guardfile</code></li>
        <li><code>ln -s ~/playground/repo-wide-scripts/run-guard</code></li>
      </ol>
      <br/>
      An example of this properly setup and working well is found in my <a href="https://github.com/mperdikeas/playground/tree/master/javascript-canvas/004-bouncing-ball-physics">bouncing ball project</a> (file <code>run-guard</code> which ultimately
      links to <a href="https://github.com/mperdikeas/playground/blob/master/repo-wide-scripts/run-guard">this script</a>).

      <a href='http://www.sitepoint.com/beginners-guide-node-package-manager/'>This</a> is a
      great guide in how to setup <tt>npm</tt> for your local environment (and how to
      configure <tt>global</tt> to point to your home directory instead).
      <br/>
      I've made a copy of the document in case the original resource goes
      offline <a href='beginners-guide-node-package-manager.html'>here</a>      <li id='npm-nvm'><b><i>NB: Deprecated</b></i>  How to use node and install npm packages in home folder</li>
      I have used the approach to install node packages via the <code>npm</code> tool in the home folder as described 
      <a href='http://www.sitepoint.com/beginners-guide-node-package-manager/'>here</a>.
      However with this approach, one (at least in Ubuntu 14.04) cannot use the <code>nodejs</code> executable
      but has to use the <code>node</code> one that is available with the <code>nvm</code> tool.
      This is described <a href='https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-an-ubuntu-14-04-server'>here</a> in the section "How to Install Using NVM".
      <strong>NB:</strong>I actually had to use <code>sudo curl .. | sh</code> to install it.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Then don't forget upon installing a package, e.g. <code>npm prompt</code> to also do <code>nvm link prompt</code>
      (as described in the link above). An example is given in:
      <pre>
        ~/playground/javascript-you-dont-know
      </pre>
      <li><i><b>NB: Deprecated (?)</b></i> install Node.js for Ubuntu</li>
      On 6.II.2015 I followed <a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions">these instructions</a> and they worked on my Ubuntu 12.04 machine.
