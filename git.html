      <li>how to resolve merge conflicts after a <tt>stash pop</tt></li>
      <p>
        The following procedure worked flawlessly in February 2025 (<a href='https://stackoverflow.com/a/27382210/274677'>provenance</a>):
        <ol>
          <li>manually resolve conflicts</li>
          <li><pre>git restore --staged src/</pre> &mdash; or some other specific path(s) as the last argument.
            <span class='nb'>NB:</span> before executing the above command, when I did <tt>git status -s</tt> I
            could still see conflict markers (<tt>UU</tt>) but went ahead nonetheless. I think that's the idea.
          </li>
          <li>drop the stash (since it was kept after the pop due to the presence of merge conflicts). Use either: 
            (a) <tt>git stash drop</tt> if only one entry is present or
            (b) <tt>git stash drop stash@{0}</tt> to only drop the topmost stash entry</li>
        </ol>

      <li>how to submit multipled pull requests add as a submodule an existing, locally available git repo</li>
      <p>
        In February 2025 I followed the below procedure and it worked like a charm.
        My situation was that I wanted to submit a pull request to a github repo
        to which I was unable to push a branch. Therefore, as per the suggested
        procedure in these cases, I forked the original repo,
        created a branch, pushed it
        (to my forked repo) and issued the pull request from <i>github.com</i>. This
        all worked with no problem. The problem came on the next step.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the owner of the repo accepted my pull request into his <i>master</i>
        branch, I obviously wanted to fetch their updated <i>master</i> branch
        wherein my pull request had been merged &mdash; not just to see
        my changes but,
        more importantly, to be able to create a new pull request out of the
        latest revision of the master branch. At that point simply doing:
        <tt>git fetch origin</tt> failed to achieve this as the <i>origin</i>
        for my local cloned repo (on my development machine) was obviously set to point to
        my own forked repo. To address this, I had to define a new <i>remote</i> for
        the upstream repo that I cloned from, and followed the below procedure:
        <dl>
          <dt><tt>$ git remote -v</tt></dt>
          <dd>to see the existing remotes</dd>
          <dt><tt>$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/kyp44/Topology.git</tt></dt>
          <dd>to add a new remote for the original repo I had cloned</dd>
          <dt><tt>$ git remote -v</tt></dt>
          <dd>to confirm the new remotes</dd>
          <dt><tt>$ git checkout master</tt></dt>
          <dd>to checkout the <i>master</i> of my forked repo into my development, locally-cloned repo</dd>
          <dt><tt>$ git fetch upstream</tt></dt>
          <dd>to fetch the <i>upstream</i> main branch</dd>
          <dt><tt>$ git merge upstream/master master</tt></dt>
          <dd>to merge the <i>upstream</i> <i>master</i> branch
            into my local <i>master</i> branch</dd>
          <dt><tt>$ git push origin</tt></dt>
          <dd>to push my local current (<i>master</i>) branch, that was
            just merged with the <i>upstream</i> <i>master</i>
            into my forked repo's remote <i>master</i> branch</dd>
        </dl>
      </p>
      <p>
        Following the above procedure I was able to not only synchronize my
        cloned repo with the <i>upstream</i> <i>master</i> but was also able
        to quickly submit another pull request. The last part was done using
        the github web application from the page of my forked repo. I don't
        know if it can be done from the command line. Following acceptance
        of my pull request I usually drop the local branch from the clone
        of my forked repo. At this point I get a message to the effect
        that "<i>The branch 'local-feature-branch' is not fully merged</i>"
        at which point I use <tt>git branch -D</tt> to forcefully delete it.

      <li>how to undo a <tt>git commit --amend</tt> and on the difference between <tt>HEAD@{1}</tt> and <tt>HEAD^</tt> (or <tt>HEAD~1</tt>)</li>
      <p>
      This <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/a/1459264/274677'>answer</a> is very deep; in my case
      I only used the first incantation:

      <pre>git reset --soft HEAD@{1}</pre>

      &hellip; but not the second one:

      <pre>git commit -C HEAD@{1}</pre>

      Instead, I typed the commit message anew.

      Note, in particular the answer's caveat that <tt>HEAD@{1}</tt> is pointing to different
      things in the two incantations. Like I said, pretty deep.

        I followed the below workflow recently:
        <pre>
git fetch origin pull/7/head:pr7
git checkout -t -b origin_master origin/master
git merge pr7
git push origin HEAD:master</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        Following the above I also did:
        <pre>
 git checkout -B master origin/master</pre>
        &hellip; whereupon I got the following message:<pre>
Branch master set up to track remote branch master from origin.
Switched to and reset branch 'master'
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.</pre>

      <li>how to cleanly rebase contributions from a collaborator</li>
      <p>This is supposedly useful when I also have commits in my local repo
        that I haven't pushed for a while while the collaborator has pushed
        his commits to github. Rebase also results in a linear history
        in contrast to merge. That was the theory at least; I tried that
        circa September 2020 and it didn't work too well &hellip;</p>
      <pre>
$ git fetch -v
$ git pull --rebase origin master</pre>
      <p>NB: there should be no slash between <i>origin</i> and <i>master</i></p>
      <p>So failing the above I had to resort to the familiar:
        <pre>
git fetch -v
git merge origin/master </pre>
      </p>
      <p>In both cases you obviously still have to deal with the merge conflicts.a</p>

      <p>In a recent rebase operation (where I was following the script given
        <a href='#workflow-for-rebase-merge'>here</a>), I had the following output:
        <pre>

        Following the advice given in the <a href='#how-to-resolve-conflicts-during-merge.source'>linked source</a>
        I did the following:
        <ol>
          <li>identified files in conflict (in the above example, that was <code>docs/release-notes</code>)</li>
          <li>resolved the conflict by editing the files that are in conflict (examining and eventually removing
            the Git demarcation markers)</li>
          <li><code>git add</code> the edited files. <span class='nb'>NB:</span> be sure to not <code>commit</code> at this point, no <code>commit</code> is necessary</li>
          <li>did a <code>git rebase --continue</code> as that was the command Git said to do when you completed.</li>
          <li>at that point, given that the rebase was successful, I saw (as expected) a <b>fast forward</b> merge.    
        </ol>
      </p>
      
      <li>how to show which files were changed as part of a commit</li>

      If the "other" branch is "master" you can do a:
      <pre>git merge-base HEAD master</pre>
      (the operation is obviously commutative)
      </p>
      <p>
        The following can also serve to graphically show the branch point:

      <li>how to stash untracked files without having to stage them</li>
      <pre>git stash save -u</pre>
      <li>examining file differences in commits</li>
      <ul>
        <li style='color: brown; text-decoration:underline;'>to get a list of files modified between any two commits (commit-id-1 and commit-id-2)<li>

          <pre>
$ git diff --name-status commit-id-1..commit-id-2</pre>

          Notes:
          <ul>
            <li>The above command reports only the name of the file and whether it was modified, deleted or added. It is meant to provide a short and compact listing of modified files so it does not report the changes as well (only the fact that a file was changed)</li>
            <li>if you omit commit-id-2 it defaults to the HEAD (i.e. latest commit in your local repo)</li>
            <li>if you omit both commit-id-1 and commit-id-2 it shows the uncommitted changes you've made locally to your repo.</li>
            <li>to see the changes made in one particular commit there's two ways: Either provide the identifiers of that commit and its ancestor OR (better) use the ^ symbol which means "the ancestor of that commit". So the command:

              <pre>
git diff --name-status fc847cb^..fc847cb</pre>

              .. shows all the changes made between the ancestor of commit git fc847cb and commit fc847cb. I.e. all the changes made in that particular commit only. E.g. if you see the following:
              <pre>
$ git diff --name-status fc847cb^..fc847cb
  M       FileA.java
  M       FileB.java
  M       FileC.java</pre>

              &hellip; it means that the above three files were modified (M) in that particular commit.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li style='color: brown; text-decoration:underline;'>to see the changes of a particular file in single commit</li>
          <p>
            Based on the example above, to see the changes made in FileB.java in the commit fc847cb (only) you can do:

            <pre>git diff fc847cb^:FileA.java fc847cb:FileA.java</pre>

            The above says: <i>show me the differences of FileA.java between the direct ancestor of commit fc847cb and commit fc847cb.</i> I.e. the differences in FileA.java made in commit fc847cb.
          </p>
          <li style='color: brown; text-decoration:underline;'>to see the changes of a particular file over a range of commits</li>
          <p>
          To see the changes of a particular file over a number of commits you just provide the range of the two commits (beginning commit and ending commit). E.g. to see how file FileA.java changed between commits 12347dd and fc847cb do:

            <pre>git diff 12347dd:FileA.java fc847cb:FileA.java</pre>
            Alternatively, the following also works:
            <pre>git diff 12347dd fc847cb -- FileA.java</pre>
            Instead of commit numbers you may use HEAD (for the tip of the current branch) or a branch name (in which case the tip of that branch is used)
          </p>
          <li style='color: brown; text-decoration:underline;'>to see recent changes on a file against another(distant) commit</li>
          <p>
            To see <b>all</b> changes (including unstaged ones):
            <pre> git diff --no-ext-diff 968da4d -- path/to/file</pre>
          </p>
          <p>To see only up to staged changes:
            <pre>git diff --no-ext-diff --staged 968da4d -- path/to/file</pre>
            Notice that in the above it is an error to give <tt>HEAD</tt> after the <tt>--staged</tt>
            as <tt>HEAD</tt> is implicit.
          </p>
          <p>To see up to the tip of the current branch:
            <pre>git diff --no-ext-diff 968da4d HEAD -- path/to/file</pre>
          </p>
      </ul>

        Based on <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/a/9147389/274677'>this</a> and <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/a/14005910/274677'>this</a>, I am now resolved to using the following workflow:
        <ol>
          <li>create feature branch by branching off master</li>
          <li>rebase on top of master</li>
          <li>merge feature branch with master (this should be a fast forward merge)</li>
          <li>remove merged branch</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>E.g.
        <pre>
$ git checkout -b cool-feature
$ git rebase master
$ git checkout master
$ git merge cool-feature
$ git branch -d cool-feature </pre>
        Note that git will bark at the branch delete command if it thinks it's not fully merged so no worries.

      <li>Show files changed in a branch</li>
      <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/a/6913546/274677'>source</a>
      <p>
        Say you branched off from <tt>master</tt> at some point in the past
        and you are now in a branch for a cool new feature.
        Given that in the meantime (i.e. since you branched-off) the <tt>master</tt> branch has also advanced
        doing (from your feature branch) the following: <pre>git diff --name-only master</pre> &hellip; will also show files
        changed in <tt>master</tt>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To actually only see differences since the point you branched off from <tt>master</tt> (and not to bother with
        subsequent <tt>master</tt> commits), you need to do (from your feature branch):
        <pre>git diff --name-only master...</pre>
        Note that there is no space between <tt>master</tt> and <tt>...</tt>

      Note that newly created (and non-added) files will remain in your working directory unless you also use the -u switch.

      <pre>git stash -k -u</pre>
        Also, your working directory must be clean (i.e. all changes need to be added) when you git stash pop later on.

      <li>how to update all submodules</li>
      <p>
      Assuming you've cloned your repository with <tt>git clone --recursive</tt> (which you always should), then do a:
      <pre>
git submodule update --recursive --remote</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        Then,
        <dl>
          <dt>for the upstream:</dt><dd>you should add the submodule and commit the repository (that hosts the submodule) and push</dd>
          <dt>for the downstream:</dt><dd>you should fetch in the repository that hosts the submodule and merge. It is not super-clear
            to me whether at the downstream you also need to do <code>git submodule update --recursive --remote</code> prior to fetching
          and merging the top-level repository.</dd>

      <li>How to discover which commit deleted a file and resurrect it</li>
      <ol>
          <li>find the path to the file </li>
          This is the first step in case you remember a few things about the file's name but have
          forgotten it's full path (which is necessary for the next step):
          <pre>git log --diff-filter=D --summary | grep delete | grep -i file-name-fragment</pre>
          <li>find the commit that deleted the file</li>
          This will be the last one (hence we are using the <tt>-1</tt> flag below):
          <pre>git log -1  --stat -- full-path-to-the-file</pre>
          <li>resurrect the file (you can also do this in some throwaway cloned repo and then copy it manually)</li>
          To perform the resurrection use the <b>previous</b> commit than the one that deleted the file (hence the <tt>^</tt>):
          <pre>git checkout commit-identifier^ full-path-to-file </pre>
      </ol>

      <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/a/8446391/274677'>source</a>
      <p>
        The gist of the idea is to create an orphan <tt>gh-pages</tt> branch which will include
        only the HTML pages you wish to publish, and then push it to the origin:
        <ol>
          <li><pre>git checkout --orphan gh-pages</pre></li>
          <li>At this point a simple <tt>git branch</tt> fails to show that you are in the
            new, orphan branch so do instead the following to verify you in the correct branch:
            <pre>git symbolic-ref HEAD</pre>
          </li>
          <li>remove / add files &hellip;</li>
          <li><pre>git add . -A</pre></li>
          <li><pre>git commit -m 'gh-pages initial'</pre></li>
          <li><pre>git push -u origin gh-pages</pre></li>
          <li>return to master:
            <pre>git checkout master</pre>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>

        becomes visible in:<br>

      The last argument is the path in which the submodule should reside.
      NB: obviously people that have already cloned the repo (prior to the addition of the
      submodule) would still have to do:
      <pre>git submodule update --init --recursive</pre>
      Otherwise (i.e. if the cloning happens <em>after</em> the addition of the submodule it is better
      to just do:

        NB: particularized instructions <a href="#particular-svn-mirroring">here</a>.
        <br>
        The instructions on <a href="http://www.kerrybuckley.org/2009/10/06/maintaining-a-read-only-svn-mirror-of-a-git-repository/">this page</a>
        worked well. Copied below in case the source goes off line:
        <br>
        <b>Create the subversion repository in the usual way, using svnadmin.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Once you've got an empty repository to point to (we'll imagine it's at http://svn.example.com/foo), you also need to commit an initial version (I also created a trunk directory in this step, in case we later decide to mirror branches too):
        <br>
        <pre>
svn co http://svn.example.com/foo
cd myproj
svn mkdir trunk
svn commit -m 'Created trunk directory'
        </pre>
        Once this is done, you can throw away the directory you checked out of subversion.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Set up the subversion remote</b>
        <br>
        This step, and subsequent ones, need to be performed on whichever git repository you want to mirror from.
        <p>
          In our case, we have a central repository running on a local installation of Gitorious. This is a bare repository, which makes things a little tricker, as git-svn requires a working copy. To get round this, we create a clone, which we’ll use as an intermediate step in the mirroring process. If you're not mirroring a bare repository, you can omit this step.
          <p>
            The repositories we want to mirror are in ~git/repositories, and we’ve created a directory ~git/repositories/svn-mirror where we'll put the clones. For this example, we'll use a repository called foo/mainline.git.
            <br>
            <b>Create the clone:</b>
            <br>
            <pre>
git clone ~git/repositories/foo/mainline.git ~git/repositories/svn-mirror/foo
cd ~git/repositories/svn-mirror/foo
            </pre>

            Now add the following to .git/config (with the correct svn URI, of course):

            <pre>
[svn-remote "svn"]
url = http://svn.example.com/foo/trunk
fetch = :refs/remotes/git-svn
            </pre>

            Now do an initial fetch of the empty subversion remote, and check it out as a new git branch (called svn):

            <pre>
git svn fetch svn
git checkout -b svn git-svn
            </pre>
            You can now merge in all your commits from master, and push them to subversion. You’ll probably want to go and make a coffee or something while the dcommit runs – if you haven’t used subversion for a while you’ve probably forgotten just how much slower it is than git.

            <pre>
git merge master
git svn dcommit
            </pre>

            To allow pushing to svn from master, rebase master to the svn branch (which can then be deleted):

            <pre>
git checkout master
git rebase svn
git branch -d svn
            </pre>
            At this point you should be able to manually update subversion at any time by running <b>git svn dcommit</b> from the master branch.


            <li>reconnect a detached head</li>
            <pre>
$ git log -1
# note the SHA-1 of latest commit
$ git checkout master
# reset your branch head to your previously detached commit
$ git reset --hard [commit-id]
            </pre>
            <li>list tags</li>
            <pre>git tag -l</pre>

            <pre>git ls-remote --tags</pre>
            <li>produce a git patch</li>
            There are two ways:
            <ul>
              <li>using <b>git-format-patch</b>:</li>
              <pre> git format-patch 3266a7e </pre>
              (in the above example all changes between identified commit and the tip of the branch will be reported)
              <li>using <b>git-diff</b>:</li>
              I suspect the <i>tags</i> in the following can be any tree-ish objects:
              <pre>git diff 3266a7e 8deaaf2 > ~/lastchanges.patch</pre>
            </ul>
            The <b>git-format-patch</b> method produces cleaner output.
            <li>git add all files in a directory hierarchy except a particular one</li>
            The following is the 'safe' version (echo):
            <pre>find . ! -type d  ! -iname nosecurity_mvn.zip -exec echo git add {} \;</pre>

                    Assuming you are sitting on that commit, then this command will wack it...
                    <pre>
    git reset --hard HEAD~1
                    </pre>
                    The HEAD~1 means the commit before head.

                    Or, you could look at the output of git log, find the commit id of the commit you want to back up to, and then do this:
                    <pre>
    git reset --hard <sha1-commit-id>
                    </pre>
                    If you already pushed it, you will need to do a force push to get rid of it...
                    <pre>
    git push origin HEAD --force
                    </pre>
                    However, if others may have pulled it, then you would be better off starting a new branch. Because when they pull, it will just merge it into their work, and you will get it pushed back up again.

                    If you already pushed, it may be better to use git revert, to create a <i>"mirror image"</i> commit that will undo the changes. However, both commits will both be in the log.

                    FYI -- git reset --hard HEAD is great if you want to get rid of WORK IN PROGRESS. It will reset you back to the most recent commit, and erase all the changes in your working tree and index.

                    Lastly, if you need to find a commit that you "deleted", it is typically present in git reflog unless you have garbage collected your repository.
