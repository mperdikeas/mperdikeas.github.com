      <h1>Write-up of how I build GeoServer from sources and deployed it to a locally installed Tomcat on my ThinkStation P320 Tower machine running <tt>Ubuntu 20.04</tt> (January 2026)</h1>
      <hr>
    </header>
    <p>
      In late January 2026 I built <tt>GeoServer v2.28</tt> from sources and deployed it to a local <tt>Apache Tomcat v9</tt> servlet container on a <tt>Ubuntu 20.04</tt> machine.
      The main steps were:
      <ol>
        <li>configuring the right version of <tt>javac</tt> to compile <tt>GeoServer</tt> with</li>
        <li>installing the right version of <tt>Maven</tt></li>
        <li>installing (and troubleshooting) the installation of <tt>Tomcat</tt></li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      The guides I used were:
      <ol>
        <li>initial, top-level
          <a href='https://chatgpt.com/s/t_6978d3b70c0c8191951d4024b9607449'>

          </a>
          outlining all steps</a> (also archived
          <a href='./travails-building-geoserver-from-sources-and-deploying-to-tomcat.html.files/ChatGPT-geoServer-v2_28-setup.pdf'>
            here
          </a>
          ).<br/>
          It should be noted that, using this guide &ndash; and after manually upgrading Maven &ndash; I was able
          to compile Geoserver from sources, including <u>all extensions</u> using this incantation (as given in the guide):<br/>
          <pre class="code">$ mvn clean install -P allExtensions -DskipTests</pre>
          <br/>If memory serves the tests were executing sort of nicely (with some warnings) but, in the end, I decided to skip them
          as they were taking far too long.

            here
          </a>. The reason this was necessary is that the version of GeoServer I wanted
          to install (<tt>v2.28</tt>) required a higher version of <tt>Maven</tt> than
          was available in the official Ubuntu repository for Ubuntu <tt>20.04</tt>.
          If memory serves the former was <tt>3.9</tt> whereas the latter <tt>3.6</tt>

            Guide on how to manually install Apache Tomcat 9 on Ubuntu 20.04

            here
          </a>. I followed this particular guide except only (if memory serves) changing
          the suggested installation location from: <tt>/opt/tomcat</tt> to:
          <tt>~/software</tt> (a decision I've come to regret, not for any particular
          technical reason but solely for the fact that the alternative location
          I chose feels weird and is not normative).
          <br/>
          It should also be noted that even though I configured the <i>Uncomplicated Firewall</i>
          with an additional rule, as suggested by the guide:<br/>
          <pre class='code'>$ sudo ufw allow 8080</pre><br/>
          &hellip; this step (<i>Step 6</i>
          in the guide) was moot in my case as I don't have the
          <tt>ufw</tt> firewall enabled on my system upon startup.
        </li>
        <li>
          Following the instructions on the above guide resulted in Tomcat being unable to start properly
          so I then entered into a
          <a href='https://chat.deepseek.com/share/aekqdv14exmy5coiuz'>
            discussion with DeepSeek
          </a> on how to troubleshoot the problem I was facing. This discussion is also
          archived
          <a href='travails-building-geoserver-from-sources-and-deploying-to-tomcat.html.files/deepseek-troubleshooting-tomcat-installation.pdf'>
            here</a>.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          In the end, I ended up modifying the <tt>systemd/system</tt> Tomcat <i>Unit file</i> from:<br/>
          <a href='travails-building-geoserver-from-sources-and-deploying-to-tomcat.html.files/tomcat.service.original'>the version originally suggested by guide #3
          </a>
          <br/>&hellip; to:<br/>
          <a href='travails-building-geoserver-from-sources-and-deploying-to-tomcat.html.files/tomcat.service.final'>this</a>.
          <br/>The above changes also account for the fact that I'm using a different version of Java than the one suggested in guide #3.
