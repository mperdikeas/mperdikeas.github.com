2012-03-05: in order to create a bootable USB drive from an ISO image it
                is not possible to use dd and perform a binary data copy.
                Special magic has to be used. Ttsiodras sent me a folder
                with the necessary magic. Bottom line is that the files
                in the ISO image are actually copied and that special bits
                are set in the flash drive's filesystem to denote the
                partition as bootable. See folder CreateUSBstickFromISO.
                However I was not able to make it work; the USB flash
                drive was formated and created but I wasn't ablt to 
                boot it. In the end I just burned a CD. BTW the following
                page:
                http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/download
                created detailed instructions on how to create a USB
                flash drive and suggests another solution ("Pen Drive
                Linux's USB Installer").

                There is also another option which is to create a Live Linux
                USB stick or even a persistent one (with the ability to
                save files, install programs and so on). This option is
                possible using the "LinuxLive USB Creator 2.8.10.exe"
                program.
2012-03-06: to find the Linux kernel release:
                uname -mrs
2012-03-06: to find the Linux distro:
                lsb_release -a
2012-03-08: how to find if a Linux machine is 32 or 64 bits:
            uname -m
             - or -

2012-03-14: how to display recursive size of folders (i.e. including
                contents):
                sudo du - s -m *
                (because ls -lah only displays the size of the
                directory file).
2012-03-14: proper way to copy recursively (including file permissions etc):
                cp -a /a /b
2012-03-15: how to find in which package a binary belongs,
            e.g. the lsb_release binary:
            dpkg -S $(which lsb_release)
2012-03-15: how to show the versions of debian apt packages:
            use the apt_show_versions utility
2012-03-15: the /etc/apt/sources.list file is not directly related to the 
            operations of the:
                apt-get dist-upgrade command
            the dist-upgrade command always stays in the same Debian version
            but implements the progression: stable->testing->unstable.
            So, for instance from the stable phase it takes two invocations
            of the dist-upgrade to reach the unstable phase; from the
            testing phase only one. And you can't go backwards.
            The /etc/apt/sources.list file "simply" provides the URL of
            the repositories for each version.
