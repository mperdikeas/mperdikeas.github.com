Steps to create a cluster in JBoss AS 7.1

We would be seeing two scenarios here one would be creating a cluster on the same box and second when creating a cluster between different boxes.
Scenario 1: Cluster on same box

    Once you have unzipped jboss-as-7.1.1.Final.zip , you would have to create two copies of standalone folder and rename them as standalone-node1 and standalone-node2 as shown below
1/home/user/jboss-as-7.1.1.Final/standalone-node1
2/home/user/jboss-as-7.1.1.Final/standalone-node2

    Note: Make sure you keep the original copy for standalone folder as it is for future usage.
    Now you would have to run the below command to start both the JBoss node in a cluster

    Node1
1./standalone.sh -c standalone-ha.xml -b 10.10.10.10 -u 230.0.0.4 -Djboss.server.base.dir=../standalone-node1 -Djboss.node.name=node1 -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=100

    Node2
1./standalone.sh -c standalone-ha.xml -b 10.10.10.10 -u 230.0.0.4 -Djboss.server.base.dir=../standalone-node2 -Djboss.node.name=node2 -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=200

    Where:
    -c = is for server configuration file to be used
    -b = is for binding address
    -u = is for multicast address
    -Djboss.server.base.dir = is for the path from where node is present
    -Djboss.node.name = is for the name of the node
    -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset = is for the port offset on which node would be running
        Note: However we need to keep in mind the following things 

        Both the nodes should have same multicast address
        Both the nodes should have different node names
        Both the nodes should have different socket binding port-offsets
    Once both the node comes up properly you would not see them in cluster, hence to make sure if both of the nodes are in a cluster then you would need to deploy the an application which has the distributable tag in web.xml . You can download one of our sample clustered application by : clicking here
    After downloading the ClusterWebApp.war you just have to keep it in (/home/user/jboss-as-7.1.1.Final/standalone-nodeX/deployments) both nodes deployments folder, just after that you would see similar below messages in both the nodes prompt, having both node names in there cluster view.

Scenario 2: Cluster on different boxes

    After unzipping JBoss AS 7 in both the boxes [i.e. box-1=10.10.10.10 and box-2=20.20.20.20 ] then you can create just a single copies of standalone folder in respective boxes

    Box-1 : 10.10.10.10
1/home/user/jboss-as-7.1.1.Final/standalone-node1

    Box-2 : 20.20.20.20
1/home/user/jboss-as-7.1.1.Final/standalone-node2
    Now you would have to run the below command to start both the JBoss node in a cluster
        Note: However we need to keep in mind the following things 

        Both the nodes should have same multicast address
        Both the nodes should have different node names
        Both the nodes should be running on the IP_ADDRESS or HOST_NAME of the box

    Node1 on Box-1 [10.10.10.10]
1./standalone.sh -c standalone-ha.xml -b 10.10.10.10 -u 230.0.0.4 -Djboss.server.base.dir=../standalone-node1 -Djboss.node.name=node1

    Node2 on Box-2 [20.20.20.20]
1./standalone.sh -c standalone-ha.xml -b 20.20.20.20 -u 230.0.0.4 -Djboss.server.base.dir=../standalone-node2 -Djboss.node.name=node2

    Here we would not have to worry about the port conflicts as we are running both the nodes on different boxes having different binding address.
    Repeat the same step-3 and step-4 of Scenario-1 and you would then see the same cluster view in each running nodes prompts.

If you are looking for running multiple clusters, then you would have to make sure you give a different set of multicast address (i.e  -u option) for each cluster.

    Hey there – I have tried this out and it seems to work great in scenario 1 but not quite in scenario 2 for me. When I have JBoss running on two separate machines, I see the join indications on both machines so I know they are talking… “Number of cluster members:2″, etc.

    But going to http://node1/ClusterWebApp and http://node2/ClusterWebApp shows no indication of session replication between the two machines. It seems like they are completely separate. Whereas when I run two nodes both on the same machine, it does seem to work.

    And if I run 3 nodes (2 on one machine, 1 on another) then again the two on the same machine share the same session information but the other server has its own, even though at this point I see “Number of cluster members: 3″. Any ideas on why the session isn’t being replicated across machines?

    Hi rc1,

    This article was written keeping in mind for just letting our subscribers know how to create a cluster in JBoss AS7 using standalone mode, however the test you are trying to do is for session replication, for which you would need an Apache in front of this created cluster only then you would be able to achieve it.

    We are planning on writing more on complete working cluster architecture, which would be coming part by part so stay tune :) as more is coming on your way ;)

    Keep Posting

    Hi,

    One of our LINUX machine hat two IPs so I try the scenario 2 on this machine. But as I start the Jboss I got ERROR and WARN such like:

    …
    11:13:32,966 ERROR [org.jboss.as.controller.management-operation] (ServerService Thread Pool — 43) JBAS014612: Operation (“add”) failed – address: ([("subsystem" => "osgi")]): org.jboss.msc.service.DuplicateServiceException: Service jbosgi.integration.PersistentBundlesHandler is already registered
    at org.jboss.msc.service.ServiceRegistrationImpl.setInstance(ServiceRegistrationImpl.java:154) [jboss-msc-1.0.2.GA-redhat-1.jar:1.0.2.GA-redhat-1]

    …

    Any idea?

    HI thomas2004,

    Looks like there is already some issue going on related to OSGI as mentione din the JIRA: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-5022
    Which seems to to be fix in 7.1.3.Final (EAP), 7.2.0.Alpha1

    .
    .
    Thanks
