{Software Architect and Lead Programmer}
{March '13 -- January '16}
{\bodytext{I was the software architect and lead coder for the
    \href{registry.euro-vo.org}{new EuroVO Registry system}
    which is scheduled to replace the \href{registry.euro-vo.org}{existing EuroVO Registry system} that had been
    serving the global \href{http://www.ivoa.net/}{IVOA} community for the last ten (10) years.

  I worked for three years with people from the \href{http://www.sciops.esa.int/index.php?project=SAT}{Science
    Archives Team at ESAC}, with little or no supervision
  and designed and implemented the entire system from scratch with the exception of most
  of the front-end web-based GUI (done in \href{http://www.gwtproject.org/}{GWT}).
  Among others, I designed and implemented:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item the \href{http://www.openarchives.org/pmh/}{OAI-PMH} harvesting functionality. I couldn't find a reliable 3rd party OAI-PMH library
    so I implemented the entire protocol from scratch.\\
    \technologies{} Java, XPath 2.0 (Saxon), XSLT, REST (Jersey), HTTP, Tomcat 7
  \item the \href{http://www.ivoa.net/documents/RegTAP/}{RegTAP} functionality and interface. I came into the project with \textbf{zero} domain-specific
    knowledge and I managed to implement the second, globally, RegTAP search interface and make material
    contributions to the RegTAP specification itself to the extent that I was recognized as a co-author of the spec.\\
    \technologies{} Java, XPath 2.0 (Saxon), REST (Jersey), JDBC, Tomcat 7
  \item the \href{http://www.ivoa.net/documents/RegistryInterface/20091104/REC-RegistryInterface-1.0.pdf}{IVOA RI1} Search interface. This is a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP}{SOAP interface}, defined in WSDL (i.e. following a top-down approach). 
    Due to the complexity of the XSDs used by the IVOA community I ran into problems with the automatic stub
    generation by tools like \href{https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/share/xjc.html}{XJC} (which I have documented in \href{http://stackoverflow.com/q/17265960/274677}{SO} and raised
    against the tool's \href{https://java.net/jira/browse/JAXB-965}{JIRA}). So I decided to implement
    my own \href{https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/share/wsimport.html}{wsimport}-like tool that reads WSDL and generates Java code (stubs and skeletons) to perform SOAP calls.\\
    \technologies{} Java, SOAP (Jersey), XSD, template-based code generation with \href{http://www.stringtemplate.org/.}{String Template}
  \item the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Schema_(W3C)}{XML XSD schema-validation}
    and the IVOA validation of the various services.
    \\
    \technologies{} Java, XML, XSD, XPath 2.0 (Saxon), HTTP.
  \item the report, email notifications and visual plots generation subsystem.
    \\
    \technologies{} Java, \href{http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/}{JFreeChart}
    \item the entire database schema for PostgreSQL. I wrote the DDL statements for the entire database which comprises 102 tables in 4 schemas and was responsible for the installation, fine-tuning, index creation, performance optimization, etc of the PostgreSQL database. Wrote the entire DB-facing \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_abstraction_layer}{DAO} code in Java.\\
      \technologies{} PostgreSQL 9.2, PL/pgSQL, JDBC, SQL.
    \item Finally, I also handled all DevOps aspects including: installing and configuring Apache Tomcat7 and the PostgreSQL cluster, authoring the entire build system based on
      Ant and \href{http://ant.apache.org/ivy/}{Ivy}, writing test cases (JUnit), coding standards checking with \href{http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/}{Checkstyle}, source code analyzers with
      \href{https://pmd.github.io/}{PMD} and \href{http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/}{FindBugs},

{Senior Software Engineer}
{June '12 -- March '13}
{\bodytext{
    I worked as a software engineer in the company's flagship \href{https://www.neuropublic.gr/en/component/k2/gaia-epicheirein}{GAIA} series of cloud-based services.
    \\
    Among the things I did:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item designed and developed all the server-side code for an expert system that advises farmers
      on the subsidies they are entitled to apply for. I devised a formal way to capture the legal requirements
      for each subsidy in the form of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression}{Lisp S-expressions}.
      The provisions and rules of each ministerial decision involving subsidies are
      modelled in the form of a declarative, Lisp-like \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language}{DSL}.
      Then the system reads from the database the profile of each user (age, income, past subsidies, location
      and size of fields, crops, animal capital) and dynamically evaluates them against all possible subsidies.
      The system finally informs the user which subsidies (s)he can apply for (based on their circumstances
      and the rules encoded in each ministerial decision) and also creates
      a visual diagram that explains to the users why they failed to qualify for certain subsidies.\\
      \technologies{} \href{https://clojure.org/}{Clojure} (for
      the dynamic evaluation of the S-expressions), dynamic evaluation of Clojure code from Java,
      \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)}{DOT} (for visualizing
      criteria logic using graphs), \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IText}{iText} for creating
      PDF reports, \href{http://www.stringtemplate.org/}{StringTemplate}, JDBC.
    \item designed and developed the authentication / authorization database and implemented all back-end Java
      code to integrate Apache Shiro into our \href{http://www.javaserverfaces.org/}{JSF} pages and deliver an elaborate RBAC authentication solution
      for all GAIA applications.\\
      \technologies{} \href{http://shiro.apache.org/}{Apache Shiro}, PostgreSQL, JDBC.
    \item implemented a \href{http://www.jython.org/}{Jython} solution integrating Java code with
      Python scripts. The objective was to
      allow the accounting people to write simple arithmetic expressions (formulas) to derive dynamically
      various fields that were used in the generation of financial reports.

{\bodytext{
    I led the company's technical participation in this project. The domain of the project was multimedia
    content delivery and streaming over a dynamically configured mesh of network caches that are co-located
    with network routers (something \textit{like} a content delivery network).
    Some of the things I did:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item designed and implemented: (a) the cache communication protocol on top of TCP and (b) custom HTTP proxies
      in Java that transparently take advantage of the caches. Also, for demonstration purposes, coded
      a few pages for video streaming solutions.
      \\ \technologies{} Java TCP networking, HTML, integration with video streaming / playback.
    \item designed and implemented a rich client overview and monitoring application that visualizes
      the utilization and available capacity of all network caches, plots graphs over time and allows
      an operator to dynamically interact with them by issuing commands or writing Python scripts
      (to automate common administrative logic) in a console-like prompt.

{\bodytext{
    I led the company's technical participation in this project. The domain of the project was home automation
    and centralized optimization and scheduling of household tasks involving use of electrical appliances
    in a system of continuously changing real-time tariffs.
    Some of the things I did:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item implemented a brute-force particle swarm optimization algorithm in Java that accepts as inputs
      a set of tasks, electricity tariffs over the next 24 hours and a weather forecast (so that solar
      panel output or heating needs may be anticipated) and calculates the best possible scheduling of
      tasks to minimize either cost or carbon footprint or a combination of both.
      \\ \technologies{} Java
    \item implemented a rich client Java application that visualizes the scheduling of the various
      tasks against the electricity tariffs
      \\ \technologies{} Java Swing
    \item implemented the client (scheduler) side of a number of controllers that are used to program or monitor
      household appliances (washing machines, refrigerators, solar panels)

{2005 -- 2007}
{\bodytext{
    I was responsible for the implementation of the critical 
    conversions functionality in both the Roaming Studio and the Roaming Components products. These products
    are the company's flagship telecom products and revolve around the processing of TAP
    files which are used in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roaming}{GSM Roaming}.
    The conversion logic is responsible for converting, e.g., a TAP file of version TAP3.11 into a file
    of version TAP3.10. The files are defined using
    different \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Syntax_Notation_One}{ASN.1} grammars both from
    a syntax and a semantics point of view so
    the transformation is a complex business logic procedure. Since there are more than 7 different \href{http://what-when-how.com/roaming-in-wireless-networks/transferred-account-procedures-billing-and-settlement/}{TAP3}
    versions and conversion had to take place between any arbitrary pair there was
    a large number of conversion routines to be written. I defined a
    \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language}{DSL} used to describe the logic
    behind these conversions (essentially transformation algorithms on deeply nested ASN.1 trees) and built a Python
    script that automatically generated C++ code implementing these transformations. In total I was able to
    reduce tens of thousands of lines of C++ code into as little as 700 conversion rules expressed in the
    above DSL
    (plus the Python script code generator).
