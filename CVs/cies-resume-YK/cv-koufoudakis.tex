{Chief Executive Officer}
{2018 -- January 2020}
{\bodytext{Neuropublic is an innovative Informatics and Technology company founded in 2003 in Piraeus,
    employing about 100 people, specialising in the development of Web, Cloud-based integrated
    information systems and applications. Neuropublic occupies a leading position in the Agricultural
    sector and provides a wide range of technological services for the private and public sector. We
    developed the first and only, to date, large-scale Internet of Things Infrastructure deployment
    in Greece, installing thousands of wireless sensors on private agrigulultural land. Beyond this,
    other notable achievements during my two-year stint as CEO were the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item creation of an innovation cluster with the goal of developing a protocol for reliably
    calculating and recording carbon footprint emissions in technology intensive farming;
    The cluster comprised 10 companies and a funding of more than 1 mil \euro{} was approved
    from the Region of Central Macedonia.

    \item our customer
	base in smart farming services increased from 5 to 15; New clients were mostly local authorities
	with a proven demand for such services, ability to secure funding, and significant synergy potential.
        \end{itemize}

\headedsubsection
{Chief Executive Officer}
{2014 -- 2018}
{\bodytext{
    GAIA EPICHEIREIN is a pioneering and innovative digital services provider company established in
	February 2014 as a result of a broad coalition between major players active in the agricultural
	business in Greece: 71 Agricultural Cooperatives all over Greece; Neuropublic S.A., and the Piraeus
	Bank Group. I led the Company from the CEO position since its inception.
        The turnover of the Company for 2018 was in the order of 30 mil \euro{}. Under my
	leadership, the Company:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item diversified its revenue streams. During the first couple of years,
        almost 100\% of the company's revenue originated from services offered to cooperatives (related to the processing
	of subsidy applications via the LPIS system). By 2018, the company had also established reliable,
	auxiliary revenue streams which contributed approximately 20\% of the total revenue.
      \item Broadened its client base; the original business plan only foresaw the provision of
        services to cooperatives.
	After approximately 3 years the Company's client base had increased 6-fold and beyond cooperatives
	the company also started providing additional services directly to farmers, agronomists and consultants.
	\item Developed an extensive associates network of 108 Farmers Service Centers (FSC) spread all over
	Greece and capable of supporting all farmers nationwide.
        \item In 2016, the Company was awarded the
	EFQM Excellence Award and in 2017 it received the distinction ``EFQM --- Committed to Excellence 2''.
        \end{itemize}

\headedsubsection
{Deputy Chief Executive Officer}
{2013 -- 2014}
{\bodytext{
    After little more than a year at Neuropublic, I was promoted to deputy CEO. During that time, the Company
	developed a cloud-based platform that offers a suite of applications for the agricultural sector. These
	include the electronic farmer card, ERP, CRM, MIS for cooperatives, traceability application for
	agriculture products, smart irrigation and fertilization solutions etc.
     The central data repository
    is an information discovery and retrieval service that covers all agricultural activities and stakeholders
    in Greece. Information is gathered (mostly) via fully automated pipelines by harvesting data from web
    sites, publicly available web services, academic publications and solicited articles written by various
    contributors. Users can access the repository through a web portal or via web services to allow for
    unmediated software integration.

    The platform, alongside its suite
    of applications, was named "Gaia Epicheirein"; the service models it enabled, and the prospects
    for further business development, prompted the creation of the eponymous spin-off
    (GAIA EPICHEIREIN) about a year later.
	My leadership and contributions to both the initial platform development effort and the subsequent
	formulation of business development strategies was the main reason that I was trusted
        with the setting-up and the CEO position in the newly formed company.

{Head of International IT Projects}
{2012 -- 2013}
{\bodytext{
    After the successful merger of Semantix with Neuropublic (which I advised and oversaw), I became the head
	of a new department with the goal of securing funding from various European organizations (including the
	research frameworks programmes). I managed to establish a team capable of bidding for, and successfully
	implementing EU-cofunded projects. This directly lead to my promotion to the position of deputy CEO. The
	revenue stream that I helped create contributed more than 1 mil €, annually, by the time I left the company.
