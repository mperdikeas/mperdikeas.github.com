Some time after I wrote all this (in the midst of the covid epidemic), I received another
email from Jannet to the effect that hardcopies will actually be mailed now that the
pandemic was over and, sure enough, some time later I received mine.

As of the time of this writing (2023-12-22) I still haven't framed the original
(but a print of the softcopy) and to be honest I am not sure where exactly the
original lies.
