Folks,

Attached are the individual Certificates for the CSC2.0 Group Achievement Award along with the head shots photo that I collected and put together for the award.  Helen Cole asked me to distribute them with a congratulations from her and the agency to each of you!!  A pre-recorded Agency Honor Award Ceremony will air on March 4th @2pm Central time.  A link will be forthcoming.

I understand that physical certificates will be printed and delivered to everyone.  I’m including Helen’s email below and the file with all of the certificates.  Please pick out your own as a keepsake.

Best regards,
-janet

Hi Janet,

Attached is a zip file of electronic individual Group Achievement Award Certificates for the CSC 2.0 Group Achievement Award. Please distribute to the team members with congratulations!  Also please give the information that on March 4th at 2 pm Central the pre-recorded Agency Honor Awards Ceremony will air – and that the link to it will be forthcoming - forwarded by you.   Also, I will be notified of the call for re-prints of the certificates by HQ – and at that time I will request physical certificates be printed and delivered for all team members.   

FYI - I inquired on the format of the ceremony recording and was told that the submitted photo collage will be shown with the reading of the name of the group and award.  This is not the personal award ceremony process we are accustomed to but the best the Agency can do in spite of the pandemic.

Congratulations to the Chandra Source Catalog 2.0 Team!

-Helen
