  I am a full stack software engineer able to design and code all layers of a modern application: browser, application server, database.
  I have worked with a variety of technologies in all tiers. In the browser: from vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript, jQuery to using UI component
  libraries like jQuery UI or DHTMLX, to Webpack / ReactJS. In the application server I've experience with a Java stack
  deployed in Tomcat or JBoss servers with both presentation oriented (Spring Web MVC / JSP) and
  service-oriented (JAX-RS, SOAP, Restlet, Jersey, RESTEasy) applications. In the database I have experience with PostgreSQL, Oracle,
  MySQL and Sybase databases.
  I am a proficient Emacs user (with an Emacs setup that I've honed over the years for maximum productivity)
  and I like to live as close to the command line as possible
  (though I can of course also use an IDE
  if required). In addition to writing the code I can
  handle the build system (Ant / Ivy), unit testing, static code analysis, coding standards and automatic compliance checking,
  code coverage, integration testing, shell-scripting, etc.
  I am also proficient  in JavaScript (ECMAScript 6 and 7) including
  the Node / Babel / Webpack ecosystem and the Mocha (unit tests) and FlowType (type checking and static code analysis) tools.


  My career spans almost 2 decades of software development in all manners of companies
  from start-ups and SMEs to world class organizations
  such as the \href{http://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESAC}{European Space Agency} and the
  \href{https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/}{Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics} (my current position).

  In my free time I study Math and develop JavaScript games which you can play at:
  \href{https://mperdikeas.github.com/games.html}{https://mperdikeas.github.com/games.html}.
    %\hairspace{}---\hairspace{}I am also currently exploring ReactJS in my free time.

{SW Application Specialist (developer)}
{October '16 -- now}
{\bodytext{I am working at the {\href{http://cxc.harvard.edu/cda/}{Chandra Data Archive}}
    at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory which is part of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (Cambridge MA).
    I am coding primarily in Java and JavaScript but also in Python.
  Projects and accomplishments in this position:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Design and implementation of the new Chandra Source Catalog web-based application. The application will allow researchers
    to search the Chandra Source Catalog and retrieve observations (under development).
    \technologies{} HTML/CSS/JavaScript (using jQuery UI and the the DHTMLX UI library), Java (Spring Web MVC), JSP, JAX-RS (RESTEasy).
  \item Designed and implemented a test suite for both the front-end (presentation-oriented) and the back-end (service-oriented)
    components of the new Chandra Proposer system (this is the system to be used by researchers wishing to submit proposals for
    use rights on the Chandra X-Ray telescope). The test suite allows us to simulate a large number of concurrent users
    interacting with the web site and is used to stress-test both the web application itself and also the login functionality
    offered by the SSO mechanism
    (see below)
    \technologies Python 2.7 (with the Requests library), Java
  \item Designed and implemented the signup and edit profile pages for the new Chandra Proposer system. \\
      \technologies{} HTML/CSS/DHTMLX/JavaScript (jQuery UI and DHTMLX), Java, Spring Web MVC, JSP, JAX-RS (RESTEasy), Sybase.
  \item Designed and implemented an SSO (Single-Sign On) solution loosely based on the
    \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Authentication_Service}{CAS protocol}. The system provides
    an \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control}{RBAC}-based Authorization
    and Authentication in a uniform manner for all participating applications. It also supports all features
    taken for granted in a modern authentication system (salted and peppered cryptographic hashes, auditing, etc.). \\
      \technologies{} HTML/CSS/DHTMLX/JavaScript, Java, JSP, JAX-RS (RESTEasy), Sybase.
    
    \item Advocated and implemented a new team-wide build system for Java WAR
      and JAR applications and libraries. The new build system is based on Ant and Ivy
      (with a local file-system based repository) and guarantees
    fully reproducible builds with no Internet connectivity requirements (i.e. no dependencies are accessed or downloaded during
    the build). The new build system
    additionally includes the following features: (a) integrated testing (via JUnit) (b) detection of bugs by means
    of static code analysis using two different but complementary solutions: FindBugs and PMD (c) style checker using
    CheckStyles to ensure code styling conformance. \\
      \technologies{} Ant, Ivy, FindBugs, PMD, CheckStyles

{Lead Programmer and Technical Project Manager}
{February '16 -- September '16}
{\bodytext{I was the lead coder and technical project manager for the RAWDAR/RADACER project which aimed
    to create a data clearing house for the telemetry of a large number (upwards of 12) of European Space Agency
    missions. The work was for the {\href{http://www.esac.com}{ESAC}} establishment though, unlike the previous project, it was
    mostly off-site.

  In this project:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item I studied telemetry and telecontrol standards for recent ESA missions.
    \item coded a library to decode BSCS telemetry files for the BepiColombo mission telemetry format. This was done mostly to gain
      familiarity with the subject domain and the relevant standards.
    \item designed and implemented a prototype REST interface to be exposed by the unified data archive.
    \item designed and implemented the database and the REST server back-end of a graphical web application that displays statistics
      on the accumulated telemetry for the various missions.
  \end{itemize}
  This project did not reach production phase.\\

{Software Architect and Lead Programmer}
{March '13 -- January '16}
{\bodytext{I was the software architect and lead coder for the
    \href{registry.euro-vo.org}{new EuroVO Registry system}
    which is scheduled to replace the \href{registry.euro-vo.org}{existing EuroVO Registry system} that had been
    serving the global \href{http://www.ivoa.net/}{IVOA} community for the last ten (10) years.

  I worked for three years with people from the \href{http://www.sciops.esa.int/index.php?project=SAT}{Science
    Archives Team at ESAC}, with little or no supervision
  and designed and implemented the entire system from scratch with the exception of most
  of the front-end web-based GUI (done in \href{http://www.gwtproject.org/}{GWT}).
  Among others, I designed and implemented:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item the \href{http://www.openarchives.org/pmh/}{OAI-PMH} harvesting functionality. I couldn't find a reliable 3rd party OAI-PMH library
    so I implemented the entire protocol from scratch.\\
    \technologies{} Java, XPath 2.0 (Saxon), XSLT, REST (Jersey), HTTP, Tomcat 7
  \item the \href{http://www.ivoa.net/documents/RegTAP/}{RegTAP} functionality and interface. I came into the project with \textbf{zero} domain-specific
    knowledge and I managed to implement the second, globally, RegTAP search interface and make material
    contributions to the RegTAP specification itself to the extent that I was recognized as a co-author of the spec.\\
    \technologies{} Java, XPath 2.0 (Saxon), REST (Jersey), JDBC, Tomcat 7
  \item the \href{http://www.ivoa.net/documents/RegistryInterface/20091104/REC-RegistryInterface-1.0.pdf}{IVOA RI1} Search interface. This is a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP}{SOAP interface}, defined in WSDL (i.e. following a top-down approach). 
    Due to the complexity of the XSDs used by the IVOA community I ran into problems with the automatic stub
    generation by tools like \href{https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/share/xjc.html}{XJC} (which I have documented in \href{http://stackoverflow.com/q/17265960/274677}{SO} and raised
    against the tool's \href{https://java.net/jira/browse/JAXB-965}{JIRA}). So I decided to implement
    my own \href{https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/share/wsimport.html}{wsimport}-like tool that reads WSDL and generates Java code (stubs and skeletons) to perform SOAP calls.\\
    \technologies{} Java, SOAP (Jersey), XSD, template-based code generation with \href{http://www.stringtemplate.org/.}{String Template}
  \item the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Schema_(W3C)}{XML XSD schema-validation}
    and the IVOA validation of the various services.
    \\
    \technologies{} Java, XML, XSD, XPath 2.0 (Saxon), HTTP.
  \item the report, email notifications and visual plots generation subsystem.
    \\
    \technologies{} Java, \href{http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/}{JFreeChart}
    \item the entire database schema for PostgreSQL. I wrote the DDL statements for the entire database which comprises 102 tables in 4 schemas and was responsible for the installation, fine-tuning, index creation, performance optimization, etc of the PostgreSQL database. Wrote the entire DB-facing \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_abstraction_layer}{DAO} code in Java.\\
      \technologies{} PostgreSQL 9.2, PL/pgSQL, JDBC, SQL.
    \item Finally, I also handled all DevOps aspects including: installing and configuring Apache Tomcat7 and the PostgreSQL cluster, authoring the entire build system based on
      Ant and \href{http://ant.apache.org/ivy/}{Ivy}, writing test cases (JUnit), coding standards checking with \href{http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/}{Checkstyle}, source code analyzers with
      \href{https://pmd.github.io/}{PMD} and \href{http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/}{FindBugs},
      code coverage with \href{http://cobertura.github.io/cobertura/}{Cobertura}, etc.

{June '12 -- March '13}
{\bodytext{
    I worked as a software engineer in the company's flagship \href{https://www.neuropublic.gr/en/component/k2/gaia-epicheirein}{GAIA} series of cloud-based services.
    \\
    Among the things I did:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item designed and developed all the server-side code for an expert system that advises farmers
      on the subsidies they are entitled to apply for. I devised a formal way to capture the legal requirements
      for each subsidy in the form of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression}{Lisp S-expressions}.
      The provisions and rules of each ministerial decision involving subsidies are
      modelled in the form of a declarative, Lisp-like \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language}{DSL}.
      Then the system reads from the database the profile of each user (age, income, past subsidies, location
      and size of fields, crops, animal capital) and dynamically evaluates them against all possible subsidies.
      The system finally informs the user which subsidies (s)he can apply for (based on their circumstances
      and the rules encoded in each ministerial decision) and also creates
      a visual diagram that explains to the users why they failed to qualify for certain subsidies.\\
      \technologies{} \href{https://clojure.org/}{Clojure} (for
      the dynamic evaluation of the S-expressions), dynamic evaluation of Clojure code from Java,
      \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)}{DOT} (for visualizing
      criteria logic using graphs), \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IText}{iText} for creating
      PDF reports, \href{http://www.stringtemplate.org/}{StringTemplate}, JDBC.
    \item designed and developed the authentication / authorization database and implemented all back-end Java
      code to integrate Apache Shiro into our \href{http://www.javaserverfaces.org/}{JSF} pages and deliver an elaborate RBAC authentication solution
      for all GAIA applications.\\
      \technologies{} \href{http://shiro.apache.org/}{Apache Shiro}, PostgreSQL, JDBC.
    \item implemented a \href{http://www.jython.org/}{Jython} solution integrating Java code with
      Python scripts. The objective was to

      various fields that were used in the generation of financial reports.

    content delivery and streaming over a dynamically configured mesh of network caches that are co-located
    with network routers (something \textit{like} a content delivery network).
    Some of the things I did:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item designed and implemented: (a) the cache communication protocol on top of TCP and (b) custom HTTP proxies

    I was responsible for the implementation of the critical

    The conversion logic is responsible for converting, e.g., a TAP file of version TAP3.11 into a file
    of version TAP3.10. The files are defined using
    different \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Syntax_Notation_One}{ASN.1} grammars both from
    a syntax and a semantics point of view so
    the transformation is a complex business logic procedure. Since there are more than 7 different \href{http://what-when-how.com/roaming-in-wireless-networks/transferred-account-procedures-billing-and-settlement/}{TAP3}
    versions and conversion had to take place between any arbitrary pair there was
    a large number of conversion routines to be written. I defined a
    \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language}{DSL} used to describe the logic
    behind these conversions (essentially transformation algorithms on deeply nested ASN.1 trees) and built a Python
    script that automatically generated C++ code implementing these transformations. In total I was able to
