    <p>
      Flow provides two similar declarative structures that however serve different purposes:
      <ul>
        <li><a href='https://flowtype.org/docs/declarations.html#_'>class declarations</a></li>
        <li><a href='https://flowtype.org/docs/classes.html#_'>interface types</a></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Their main differences are the following:
      <ul>
        <li>class types are nominal (structurally identical classes are not interchangeable)</li>
        <li>interface (as well as object) types are structural</li>
        <li>the main use case of class declarations is to allow client code using those classes
          to type-check without having the implementation code available for typechecking.
          Note, in that regard the following caveats (from the online Flow documentation):
          <blockquote>
Note that declarations are exclusively compile-time entities: they are transpiled away, so they have no effect at run time. In fact, declarations without backing implementations may cause typechecked uses to break at run time! 
          </blockquote>
          &hellip; and:
          <blockquote>
            Note that it is entirely up to the programmer to ensure that declared definitions actually exist, and have the correct types.
          </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>as a consequence of the above I have found interfaces to be more usefull (if not the only way) for typing the contract / behaviour of a base class and supporting polymorphism for the derived classes</li>
        <li>yet, it appears that only classes can be parameterized (<a href='https://flowtype.org/docs/classes.html'>polymorphic classes</a>) and this is a feature I've used (see this <a href='https://github.com/mperdikeas/playground/blob/master/javascript/react/my-projects/26-block-optimization/es6/trees.js'>tree class</a>) whereas I am not sure whether interfaces can also be parameterized</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The following playground projects of mine demonstrate the differences:
      <ul>
        <li>For interfaces: <a href='https://github.com/mperdikeas/playground/tree/master/javascript/node/06-evaluating-flow-interfaces'>evaluating flow interfaces</a></li>
        <li>For class declarations: <a href='https://github.com/mperdikeas/playground/tree/master/javascript/node/07-evaluating-flow-classes'>evaluating flow classes</a></li>
      </ul>
