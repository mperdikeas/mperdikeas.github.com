      <li>how to see which version of a file gets picked up by the view I am currently in</li>
      <pre>ct ls -l some/file</pre>

      <li>how to see the commit history of a particular file</li>
      <pre>ct lshistory some/file</pre>
      &hellip; the above command reports latest commits first (higher up in the

      To see the year as well, do:
      <pre>ct lshistory -long some/file</pre>

      <pre>ct lsview</pre>
      <li>how to examine the view configuration of a particular view</li>
      <p>
        First of all you need to "enter" that particular view.
        You should know by now that there are two ways to "enter" a particular
        view (say view <i>some-view-name</i>):
        <ul>
          <li>by using <code>ct setview some-view-name</code> which gives you a new shell
            (this is really the old way)</li>
          <li>by <tt>cd</tt>-ing into the <tt>/view/some-view-name</tt> directory (which is the
            presently recommended way to do it). To <tt>cd</tt> there, the <i>some-view-name</i> directory
            needs to be created first and the way to do this is as a side effect of a <code>ct setview</code> command
            invocation as described in <b>NB2</b> <a href='#setview-is-necessary-to-create-view-directories'>here</a></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you're <i>in</i> that view (whatever "<i>in</i>" may mean) you simply do:
        <pre>ct catcs</pre>
        &hellip; to see that view's configuration.
      </p>
      <span class='nb'>NB:</span> rules that appear first (higher up) in the <code>ct catcs</code> output take precedence over rules that appear further down.
      <li>how to edit your view configuration to pickup a specific version of a specific file</li>
      In my particular case, I had the file showcased in <a href='#how-to-list-all-versions-and-labels-on-a-file'>this tip</a> where the latest version was <code>/main/dbdev_br/5</code> (and was also laballed <code>ANTBUILD</code>). My original config spec was the following:
<pre>
$ ct catcs
element * CHECKEDOUT
element /vobs/ASC_BUILD/... ANTBUILD
element src/db/... .../dbdev_br/LATEST
element * /main/LATEST -mkbranch dbdev_br </pre>
&hellip; and was pointing at the <code>/main/dbdev_br/5</code> version. To nail that file to the <code>/main/dbdev_br/4</code> version I only had to add a single line (using <code>ct edcs</code>) as follows:
<pre>
  $ ct catcs
  element * CHECKEDOUT
  element /vobs/ASC_DB_WEB/src/db/www/ant-buildsystem/ivy-filesystem-resolver-root.properties .../dbdev_br/4
  element /vobs/ASC_BUILD/... ANTBUILD
  element src/db/... .../dbdev_br/LATEST
  element * /main/LATEST -mkbranch dbdev_br
</pre>
      <li id='how-to-list-all-versions-and-labels-on-a-file'>how to list all versions and labels on a file</li>
      Take advantage of the pseudo-filesystem that CC uses &emdash; accessible with the <i>@@</i> symbols. Since the CC pseudo-filesystem is accessible like any normal filesystem, you can use typical programs such as <code>tree</code> or <code>find</code>. Example output:
      <pre>
$ tree  /view/mperdike_dev_view/vobs/ASC_DB_WEB/src/db/www/ant-buildsystem/ivy-filesystem-resolver-root.properties@@

      <li>text_file_delta: Error: "some/file" is not a 'text file': it contains a line exceeding 8000 bytes.</li>
      <p>The despicable, cold-war era, shitty "product" ClearCase somehow thinks that
        text files cannot include lines extending 8000 bytes. When you try to commit
        a minified Javascript library this "feature" will rear its ugly head:
        <pre>
$ ct mkelem -ci -nc jquery-3.2.1.min.js
Created element "jquery-3.2.1.min.js" (type "text_file").
Created branch "dbdev_br" from "jquery-3.2.1.min.js" version "/main/0".
text_file_delta: Error: "jquery-3.2.1.min.js" is not a 'text file': it contains a line exceeding 8000 bytes.
Use a different type manager (such as compressed file).
cleartool: Error: Type manager "text_file_delta" failed create_version operation.
cleartool: Error: Unable to check in "jquery-3.2.1.min.js".</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        To fix the above, use:
        <pre>cleartool chtype compressed_file jquery-3.2.1.min.js</pre>
        &hellip; once you do that you don't need to re-run <i>mkelem</i> as the
        element already exists:
        <pre>
$ ct mkelem -ci -nc jquery-3.2.1.min.js
cleartool: Error: Entry named "jquery-3.2.1.min.js" already exists.
cleartool: Error: Unable to create element "jquery-3.2.1.min.js".</pre>
        &hellip; Instead, running <i>ci</i> is enough:
        <pre>
$ ct ci -nc jquery-3.2.1.min.js
Checked in "jquery-3.2.1.min.js" version "/main/dbdev_br/1".

      <li>command to "start" a view</li>
      Apparently the below is sometimes needed following a ClearCase restart:

      <pre>

    ct mkdir dirname
    ct ci &lt;parent directory&gt;</pre>
      <li>commit an existing file or symlink in ClearCase</li>
      <p>
      If it's a regular file:
      <pre>
    ct co &lt;parent directory&gt;
    ct mkelem -ci file
    ct ci &lt;parent directory&gt;</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        If it's a symlink:
        <pre>
      $ ct co -nc .
      Checked out "." from version "/main/branchname/6".
      $ ct ln -slink ../../some/other/filename filename
      Link created: "filename"
      $ ct ci -nc .
      Checked in "." version "/main/branchname/7"</pre>

        See the following SO question of mine:
        <ul>
          <li><a href='http://stackoverflow.com/q/40347421/274677'>working in /vobs/some/path versus /view/view-tag-name/vobs/some/path</a></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Bottom line is that <tt>ct setview</tt> is evil and you can simply work in <tt>/view/view-tag-name/vobs/some/path</tt>.
        I've also confirmed that with colleagues. The only caveat is that I've only tried this with dynamic views (not snapshots).

      <li>awesome tool to import an arbitrary directory structure into a ClearCase view</li>
      <p>
        The <code>clearfsimport</code> makes working with the ClearCase abomination borderline bearable.
        It works both for the initial importation of some arbitrary directory structure (and propertly handles symlinks
        too) and also for subsequent updates.
        In the below incantation assume that:
        <ul>
          <li>the current directory is some ClearCase dynamic view and we are right above the directory <code>foo</code>
          that we're trying to import</li>
          <li>the path <code>/tmp/foo</code> is just a random filesystem directory, outside of ClearCase</li>
        </ul>
        <pre>clearfsimport -recu -nset /tmp/foo/ . </pre>
      </p>
      <p>For some inscrutable reason the <code>-nset</code> flag is essential. For more see
        <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/q/42371537/274677'>here</a>.</p>
      <p>
        To perform an update (after the initial import) simply additionally use the <tt>-rmname</tt> flag
        in the above incantation:
        <pre>clearfsimport -recu -nset -rmname /tmp/foo/ .</pre>
        For more on the update functionality, see <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/q/42396640/274677'>here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following the above, I have been advised (by CfA people) to also issue the following (after doing a <tt>cd</tt> to <tt>foo</tt>):
        <pre>ct protect -chmod ug+w $(find -type d)</pre>
      </p>              
      <p>
        Note that I've only tried the above in dynamic views, not snapshots.
      </p>

      <p>
        <tt>rm</tt> is an alias for <tt>rmname</tt>.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point in time it is not clear to me how <tt>rm</tt> / <tt>rmname</tt> is different
        from <tt>ct rmelem</tt>. Our ClearCase resident expert
        suggested using <tt>ct rm/rmname</tt> and that indeed does the trick (recursively)
      </p>
      <p>My impression at the moment is that <tt>rmelem</tt> is of a more permanent nature whereas
        with <tt>rmname</tt> you maintain history.

      <li>how to delete a view in ClearCase</li>
      I have only tried this with a snapshot view but I believe it works with dynamic views
      as well:
      <pre>
ct rmview -f -tag mperdike_dev_viewsnap
      </pre>
      <p>
      From what I observed this deletes the (server-side) "view storage directory" that's provided with
      the <code>-vws</code> in the <code>ct mkview</code> invocation for a <a href='#create-snapshot-view'>snapshot view</a>.
      I believe I had to delete the "snapshot view directory" (in my local file system) manually.
      </p>
       <li id='create-snapshot-view'>how to create a snapshot view in ClearCase</li>
      Here's the incantation I recently used:
      <pre>
ct mkview -sna -tag mperdike_dev_viewsnap -vws /data/VIEWS/mperdike_dev_viewsnap.vws -host serverhostname -hpath /data/VIEWS/mperdike_dev_viewsnap.vws -gpath /data/VIEWS/mperdike_dev_viewsnap.vws /export/mperdike/cc-snap-views/mperdike-dev-viewsnap</pre>
      Here's my understanding:
      <ul>
        <li><dt><code>-sna</code></dt><dd>this flag triggers the creation of a snapshot view (as opposed to a dynamic view)</dd>
        <li>the <code>-tag</code>, <code>-hpath</code>, <code>-gpath</code> arguments have the same meaning as in the creation of a <a href='#create-dynamic-view'>dynamic view</a></li>
        <li><dt><code>-vws</code></dt><dd>this is an argument that uniquely applies in the case of the snapshot views only.
          It provides the "view storage directory" on the server. In the case of dynamic views the same information is passed
          not through an optional argument but as the mandatory last argument (described in the documentation as "dynamic-view-storage-pname"
          or "dynamic-view-pname")</dd></li>
        <li>the last argument (<tt>/export/mperdike/cc-snap-views/mperdike-dev-viewsnap</tt> in the above incantation) is the location on my local filesystem where
          the snapshot view will be created. I have seen this being referred in the documentation as "snapshot view directory"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      Following the creation of the snapshot view, it is of course empty and one has to edit the config spec. In my case, I already had a dynamic view and just
      wanted the snapshot view to mirror the dynamic view, so I did a:
      <code>ct catcs</code> in the dynamic view and then used <code>ct edcs</code> in the snapshot view to copy
      (verbatim) all rules (selection rules) that appeared in the dynamic view config spec.
      Following that, I added (in my case) a single load rule specifying the vob I wanted to load.
      </p>
      <p>
        So in my case, the dynamic view config spec is:
        <pre>
$ ct catcs
element * CHECKEDOUT
element src/db/... .../dbdev_br/LATEST
element * /main/LATEST -mkbranch dbdev_br </pre>
        &hellip; whereas the snapshot view config spec is:
        <pre>
$ ct catcs
element * CHECKEDOUT
element src/db/... .../dbdev_br/LATEST
element * /main/LATEST -mkbranch dbdev_br
load /vobs/ASC_DB_ADMIN/ </pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the snapshot view's config spec was saved, stuff started to get downloaded. I noticed that in addition to
        the vob I specified some additional ones were downloaded (presumably due to some dependency?).

      Here's my understanding:
      <ul>
        <li><dt><code>-host</code></dt><dd>the <code>-host</code> argument should provide the server where CC runs</dd></li>
        <li><dt><code>-tag</code></dt><dd>the <code>-tag</code> argument provides the view tag (i.e. a friendly name)</dd></li>
        <li>the <code>-hpath</code> and <code>-gpath</code> arguments as well as the last mandatory parameter take their names
          (as a convention I guess) from the <code>-tag</code> argument and basically specify the view storage location on the server.
