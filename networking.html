      <li>switch vs. bridge</li>
      <a href='https://serverfault.com/q/78184/139074'>source</a>
      <p>
      A <i>switch</i> is not a proper technical term (the IEEE 802.1D standard does not even mention the word "switch").
      So a <i>switch</i> is just a marketing name for a <i>multiport bridge</i>. A <i>bridge</i>, in turn,
        is a layer 2 (data link) device that splits <i>collision domains</i> but <u>not</u> <i>multicast domains</i>.
        A hub is level 1 device that doesn't split collision domains (and therefore neither does it split broadcast domains)
        and knows nothing about MAC addresses. A hub only sees bits as it
        resides at the physical layer and simply repeats them to all its ports.
        A bridge is more intelligent in that it only floods initially, but over time, learns
      the MAC addresses of the computers connected to its ports and will eventually forward frames (the name for Layer 2 packets) only to the right
      ports.

      <li>show local listening ports and which processes listen on them:</li>
      <pre>sudo lsof -P -i -n</pre>
      More recently, I did the following to find the port an emacs daemon listens to:
      <pre>
ps aux | grep -i emacs | grep -v grep
      </pre>
      &hellip; and then (after having discovered the port number from the previous command):
      <pre>
$ lsof -Pan -p 32605 -i
COMMAND   PID       USER   FD   TYPE  DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
emacs   32605 mperdikeas    5u  IPv4 5351989      0t0  TCP 127.0.0.1:58545 (LISTEN)
      </pre>
      <p>
        Yet more recently, I used the <tt>netstat</tt> program which has the option
        <tt>-l</tt> for listening sockets and can further narrow them down by type:
        <dl>
          <dt>-lt</dt><dd>listening TCP ports</dd>
          <dt>-lu</dt><dd>listening UDP ports</dd>
          <dt>-lx</dt><dd>listening UNIX ports</dd>          
        </dl>
        &hellip; together with the <tt>-p</tt> (<tt>--program</tt>) option one can get the PID and the name of the program listening on that port.
      </p>
      <p>For example, to find the process ids of all Emacs daemons listening on UNIX sockets I did a:
        <pre>
netstat -lxp | grep -i emacs
        </pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        The <tt>ss</tt> tool can also provide the same information as the last incantation with:
        <pre>ss -lpx | grep -i emacs</pre>
      </p>
      <li>recursively copy directory to remote machine while maintaining symlinks</li>
      <p>
      When recursively copying with <tt>scp</tt>, symlinks are copied rather than
      being preserved, and so <tt>rsync</tt> has to be used instead.
      </p>
      <p>The following incantation has worked for me:
        <pre>rsync -avz -e ssh esac-rawdar/ user@172.17.12.55:/home/user/ESA/RAWDAR
        </pre>
        &hellip; and recursively copied folder "<tt>esac-rawdar</tt>" to the remote
        machine while preserving symlinks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b style='color:blue;'>CAVEAT:</b>when the directories to copy over the network include cryptographic
        file containers like TrueCrypt it may be the case that the container (for privacy reasons) does not update
        the modification timestamp (this is configurable in TrueCrypt) and since the total size of the container
        also doesn't change, then the heuristic algorithm that <tt>scp</tt> uses may fail to copy the file.<br/>
        In those cases the <tt>--ignore-times</tt> (or <tt>-I</tt>) or <tt>--checksum</tt> flags are necessary.
        See <a href='http://serverfault.com/a/211083'>this SO answer</a> and my comment to it.

      <li>bind to a port, continuously, and print on standard out whatever gets sent to that port</li>
      Use the <b>Netcat</b> tool (abbreviation: <b>nc</b>) with the <tt>-k</tt> option as in (e.g. to bind
      to port 4444):
      <pre>nc -k -l 4444</pre>
      NB: In my Ubuntu system I've tried the above with the nc from the netcat-openbsd package (not the
      alternative nc is available in the netcat-traditional package).
      <li>see the redicts of a web page</li>
      Use the <b>curl</b> utility with the <b>-I</b> and <b>-L</b> options
      (to show the headers and to follow the redirects, respectively) as follows:
      <pre>curl -I -L www.google.com</pre>
      <li>use a single outgoing IP address</li>
      When behind a corporate NAT/firewall the packets you sent out 
      (e.g. from you browser) may
      seem to emerge from two different IP addresses which could
      result in your being evicted. In those cases,
      find a remote system you have access to and open an ssh tunnel to
      it:
      <pre>ssh -L 2095:localhost:2095 root@trusted.remote.system.com</pre>
      You can then point your browser to the address: <b>localhost:2095</b><p/>
      (the above instructions work provided your browser was redirected to
      port <i>2095</i> of the remote host to begin with). This will
      stabilize the IP address the remote system sees your packets
      coming from.
      <li>virtual Ethernet interface</li>
      A virtual IP address is created as simply as:
      <pre>ifconfig eth0:1 172.31.129.121</pre>
      and is only visible on the same machine and (?) LAN segment.
      The above incantation produces an eth1 interface with the
      indicated address. Local servers can then bind on that interface.
      You can also ping it from a remote machine and watch the MAC address
      enter that remote machine's <b>arp</b> cache. However it is not currently
      possible to assign a MAC address to that virtual interface that's different
      from the real one.
      <li>How to view multicast groups</li>
      Below are some incantations that work (I haven't correlated amongst them):
      <pre>
netstat -g
/sbin/ip maddress list
ifconfig eth0 | grep MULTICAST
      </pre>
      <li>Multicast groups</li>
      Joining and leaving multicast groups can be done totally at the application layer
      when one opens a socket. Accordingly for software that has this concept (like JBoss AS7
      in 'high availability'/clustering mode), you provide the multicast address at the
      command line, you don't need to set anything administratively in the routing tables
      or elsewhere.
      <p><b>NB:</b>There's no such concept as 'joining a multicast group'. The concept is
        'joining a multicast group on a particular interface'.
        <li>arp</li>
        To see the <b>arp</b> tables (I believe there is some caching and therefore also expiry involved)
        of your local machine do a:
        <pre>sudo arp -a</pre>
        This will show known IP and MAC addresses for the hosts you've send packets to. Surprisingly
        (but perhaps not so since everything is routed and the <b>arp</b> tables only cache values for the
        LAN segment, i.e. the 1st hop towards the router), you'll see very few hosts there. This is the
        output on my machine:
        <pre>
$ sudo arp -a

        <li>use <b>nc</b> for HTTP troubleshooting</li>
        First of all use nc.traditional:
        <pre>
sudo apt-get install netcat-traditional
        </pre>
        Then spawn the <b>nc.traditional</b> binary in a loop
        (that's ok since the socket opens and dies with every request
        according to the stateless character of the HTTP protocol):
        <pre>
while true ; do nc.traditional -l -p 8085 ; done
        </pre>
        With the above command we've opened a manual HTTP server listening at
        port 8085. One can now point the browser to: localhost:8085/foo
        and we'll see the request on the <b>nc.traditional</b> output.
        What's more, we'll be able to paste a response and see it in the browser.
        Moreover, after the exchange the <b>nc.traditional</b> binary
        won't die but (due to the while true) be available to service 
        the next request coming from the browser. This allows us to test
        the cookie setting behaviour and parameters. E.g. (see the <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/cookie_spec.html">Netscape spec</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12247265/cookie-storing-strategies-and-tabbed-browsing-of-different-jsf-applications-givi">
