<li>how to display differences between two different revisions of a file in SVN</li>
The main idea is the following command:
<pre>
svn diff --diff-cmd diff -x -uw -r 4050:4054 database/vo-common-dml.sql
</pre>
The results can be visually improved by two ways:
    <ul>
    <li>by employing the <tt>colordiff</tt> tool:</li>
    <pre>
sudo apt-get install colordiff
svn diff --diff-cmd diff -x -uw -r 4050:4054 database/vo-common-dml.sql | colordiff
    </pre>
    <li>by employing the <tt>Meld</tt> application and my <tt>svndiffMELD</tt> script (lives in <tt>~/tools</tt>):</li>
    <pre>
svn diff --diff-cmd svndiffMELD -x -uw -r 4050:4054 database/vo-common-dml.sql
    </pre>
    </ul>

<li>how to bring back from the dead an entire directory that has been <i>svn rm</i>ed and <i>svn commit</i>ed</li>
I accidentaly <code>svn rm</code>ed two directories. I.e. instead of doing the following:
<pre>
svn mv dir-a dir-b && svn commit -m "foo"
</pre>
&hellip; which was my intention, I mistyped and executed the dreaded:
<pre>
svn rm dir-a dir-b && svn commit -m "foo"
</pre>
The following command (executed at the root of my entire repository) save the day:
<pre>
svn merge -r COMMITTED:PREV .
</pre>
(followed by a <code>svn commit</code>).
<br/>
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/4527194/274677">source</a>
<li>get a previous version of a file</li>
<pre>svn update -r 666 file</pre>
<br/>&hellip; or to just view it without changing the working copy:
<pre>svn cat -r 666 file | less</pre>
<li>do a visual diff between a file and a revision of it</li>
<pre>svn diff -r 2250 [filename] --diff-cmd meld</pre>
<li>show which commits changed a specific file</li>
<pre>svn blame [filename]</pre>
<li>message "obstructing working copy was found"</li>
I've encountered the following message upon <code>svn update</code>:
<pre>
$ svn update
Updating '.':
Skipped 'ivoa-console-utils/sval' -- An obstructing working copy was found
At revision 3257.
Summary of conflicts:
  Skipped paths: 1
</pre>

Sometimes just doing an <code>svn cleanup</code> seems to work.
<br><br/>
Otherwise try the following
(in conjunction with a cleanup):
<ol>
<li><code>mv</code> the .svn directory out of the way to some other location in the filesystem (outside of the SVN tree)</li>
<li>do an <code>svn update</code> and <code>svn status</code> (you should see a bunch of files marked with `D`)</li>
<li><code>mv</code> the .svn directory back in place</li>
<li><code>svn update</code> is now (mysteriously) clean.</li>
</ol>

<br><br/>
Or also try instead of the above silly moving around of directories to <code>svn co</code> the problematic directory somewhere outside the
SVN tree and then move it in place (after <code>rm</code>-ing the previous directory that existed in its place), again
in conjunction with <code>svn cleanup</code>.
<br><br/>
Sprinkle the above instructions liberally with a few <code>svn revert</code> too.
Yeah, it's a bit ugly and non-deterministic I am afraid.

<li>dreaded tree conflicts</li>
A response like the following upon <code>svn status</code> (following a <code>svn update</code>):
<pre>
$ svn status
D     C sval
      >   local unversioned, incoming add upon update
</pre>
... probably indicates a <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-dug-conflicts.html">tree conflict</a>.
What has worked for me (assuming the above directory name) is:
<pre>
$ svn resolve --accept working sval
Resolved conflicted state of 'sval
$ svn revert sval
Reverted 'sval'
$ svn status
$
</pre>
(following the advices found <a href="http://tomhennigan.blogspot.com/2012/01/resolve-tree-conflict-svn-local.html">here</a>
and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/3985504/274677">here<a/>).
<br/><br/>
However oftentimes even the above doesn't work and then (after following the above steps) I resorted to executing the following
sequence of actions:
<ol>
<li>deleting the directory locally</li>
<li>doing a <code>svn co</code> of the problematic directory in some other location</li>
<li><code>mv</code>-ing the just checked-out directory to where it is supposed to be</li>
</ol>
<br/>Of course this wipes any untracked files so better than deleting
the directory in step #1 above is to just move it out of the way so you can copy back any untracked
files after step #3.
<li>recover deleted files from an SVN repository</li>
Find the revision on which the file was present with <code>svn log --verbose</code>.
<br/>
Then, (assuming the revision was 'r144' and the file 'foo') do a:
<pre>
svn up -r 144 foo
</pre>
It seems to correctly restore directories too (all files in said directory are restored to
the state they had as of that revision).
<li>to add all local files (but not the ignored ones)</li>
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/837581/274677">source</a>
<br/>On the Commandline you can't use
<pre>svn add *</pre>
This will also add the ignored files, because the command line expands * and therefore svn add believes that you want all files to be added. Therefore use this instead:
<pre>
svn add --force .
</pre>
<li>un-add files in SVN</li>
<pre>svn revert --recursive folder_name</pre>
or
<pre>svn rm --keep-local folder_name</pre>

Note that the semantics of the above command are: 'merge the changes found in the

(in this case, 1500).<p/>
To merge a whole contiguous range of revisions you do a:

<li>the dreaded '&ltsome-dir&gt/.svn containing working copy admin are is missing' problem in SVN</li>
What has worked for me is the following sequence:
<ol>
<li><b>svn co</b> in some other location</li>
<li><b>cp -pr .svn</b> to where it's supposed to go</li>
<li><i>(not always - depending on the circumstances)</i></li>
doing a <b>svn rm --force &ltsome-dir&gt</b>
</ol>
The second step gets dir of the <b>'~'</b> SVN status symbol and I can
then proceed to either remove the offending folder (if that was the intention) or what have you. See also <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1394076/how-to-fix-containing-working-copy-admin-area-is-missing-in-svn">this SO article</a>

<li>getting the .svnignore settings for the current folder</li>

<li>renaming, moving files / directories and creating directories</li>
Such operations cannot be done from the shell alone. You'll have to use:
<pre>
svn mv
svn mkdir
</pre>
<li>how to add ignore files in SVN</li>
use the <u>setUnversionedToSVNignore.sh</u> script once you're satisfied
that all the files reported with '?' in the <u>svn status</u> are
files you want to add to <u>svn:ignore</u>. Then, to commit
the svn:ignore properties of the folders thusly changed its enough
to commit the roo folder, or each one of them individually.
<li>how to undo SVN commits</li><p>
Say you wish to go back from commit 75 to commit 68.
There are two ways:
<ol>
<li>use svn merge</li>
<li>do it manually</li>
</ol>
With the <b>svn merge</b> route you do a:
<pre>
svn merge -r 75:68
</pre>
followed by a new SVN commit to push the reverted r68 to the tip.
<p>
With the manual way, you create a new folder just to checkout the previous
version you wish to revert to (say r68) and do some file-hacking there.
Let's call that folder "r68checkoutFolder". This is the source folder
for most of the below operations. The target folder is the "checkout75" (latest commit
SVN tip) folder. So, in the <i>r68checkoutFolder</i>
you do a:
<pre>
svn checkout -r 68 https://192.168.0.8/svn/neuro-jsf-pilot/trunk
</pre>
Then you remove all metadata svn files using:
<pre>
find . -iname .svn | xargs rm -rf
</pre>
Now you want to remove from the target (latest release folder) all files that were added since r68. So you do a:
<pre>
cd /path/to/checkout68 ; find . -type f -exec rm /path/to/checkout75/'{}' \;
</pre>
Then you remove all files in r68 that are identical in r75. To do that
we use the ttsiodras utility <b>cmpDir1andDir2andRemoveSamesFromDir1</b>:
<pre>
cmpDir1andDir2andRemoveSamesFromDir1 r68checkoutFolder /path/to/checkout75
</pre>
And then remove all empty folders using:
<pre>
find . -type d -depth | xargs rmdir
</pre>
At this point, what's left in the <i>r68checkoutFolder</i> is the files that
were modified between revisions 68 and 75. And we are also guaranteed
that any new files in r75 have been deleted.
So all that's left is move the remaining files over to r75:
<pre>
find . -type f -exec mv '{}' /path/to/checkout75/'{}' ';'
</pre>
At the end of the move it should be the case that the source folder is empty.
If this is so, we can then follow and close the manual process with a commit
at the target folder:
<pre>
svn commit -m "manually reverted back to r68"
</pre>
