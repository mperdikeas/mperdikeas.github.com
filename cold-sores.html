  <h1 style='font-size: 115%'>Diet to prevent cold sores (Herpes Simplex) outbreaks (or speedup their healing)</h1>
<ol>
<li>Avoid arginine, load up on lysine but don't get too acid (too much dairy products and fruits might make your body too acid and an acid environment is good for the virus).</li>
<li>Avoid citrus fruits like the plague (too acid).</li>
<li>Use a Q-tip coated in vaseline to apply Zovirax
so that your fingers never come in contact with the virus (to prevent secondary infections).
Vaseline ensures that the cotton tip of the Q-tip doesn't absorb the Zovirax cream.</li>
<li>On the dry-versus-moist question,
keep it moist with a coat of Zovirax (lack of oxygen kills the virus).</li>
<li>Once the scab forms apply only vaseline on the scab itself (makes the scab fall off faster) and Zovirax around the corners.</li>
<li>After the scab falls off (<u>on its own</u>, never pick it even the tiniest bit) apply Carmex cream for an extra week to speed up healing</li>
<li>I've also heard good things about the herb "Melissa Officinalis" (melissoxorto) but haven't tried it.</li>
<li>The next links are a must-read:
<a href="lysine_arginine_foods.pdf">Lysine/Argenine ratios</a>
<a href="lysine_arginine_foods.html">Lysine and Argenine foods</a>
</li>
<li>Toss your toothbrush afterwards (the virus can live on it for quite some time)</li>
</ol>
